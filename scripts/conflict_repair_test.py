"""CONFLICT-REPAIR-SETTLE-2 offline test (2026-10-19, PR 2603 review, charter pillar autonomy).

settle_issue closes the repair issue of a merged or closed pull request. It failed for good on the live schema: issue_triage
.sla_due_at is NOT NULL with no default, and SQLite checks NOT NULL before an ON CONFLICT upsert. This runs the statements
against an in-memory SQLite with the LIVE issue_triage definition (read from sqlite_master of qnfo-audit on 2026-10-19) and the
live close triggers (issue_close_evidence_required with CLOSE-BINDS-TO-PROBE-1, issue_close_evidence_weak_predicate_upd), so a
statement the real database would refuse fails here.
