"""SYNC-VERSION-CAPTURE-1 (issue #1509, AUDIT-PROBE-DEGENERATE-VERSION-NULL-1).

Measured 2026-09-30: worker_live_audit carried live_version = NULL for 110/110
rows, INCLUDING the 5 rows whose note was 'SYNC'. A SYNC row is written by
scripts/fleet-autoaudit.py from the guard's `sync_workers` class, and the guard
(scripts/deploy-drift-guard.py) emitted that class as BARE WORKER-NAME STRINGS:

    sync_workers.append(worker)

so the consumer had no version to write and called

    put(w, 200, None, None, 1, "SYNC")

match=1 therefore proved only that the worker answered /health, NOT that repo and
live versions agreed -- a degenerate pass that silently downgraded every
version-sync check in the fleet (the same defect class as the drift it is meant
to catch: a check that cannot fail).

F1 guard   : emit the {worker, dir, version} object shape every other class uses.
F2 consumer: read the version off the object; keep tolerating the legacy
             bare-string form so an older guard cannot crash the consumer
             (mixed-version safety during rollout).

Fail-closed: exits 1 unless BOTH post-states carry the required predicates.
Idempotent : re-running on an already-patched tree is a no-op.
