-- RM-ADR-013-014-ENFORCEMENT-1 (roadmap_implementation 115, charter pillar security; session w2d2, 2026-11-05).
--
-- What the two accepted ADRs ask for, and what was missing (read live 2026-11-05):
--   * ADR-013 (legal immutability): a published artifact is never silently changed. paper_change_ledger (PAPER-LEDGER-1) already refuses UPDATE and DELETE of its own rows, but nothing
--     could show that the ledger itself had not been rewritten by someone who drops the triggers, and the ledger was signed by nothing.
--   * ADR-014 (authorship mandate: the individual, Rowan Brad Quni-Gudzinas, is the attributed author; an organisation byline is not): nothing checked a paper at publish. Read live: 276 of 726 published
--     or distributed papers carry an organisation byline ("QNFO Research", "QNFO", "QNFO Research Agent"), every one first published on or before 2026-08-04; the 296 papers first published since
--     2026-09-01 all carry the owner.
--   * The ADR texts themselves are not readable: both R2 objects (qnfo-audit bucket, adr/ADR-013-LEGAL-IMMUTABILITY.md and adr/ADR-014-AUTHORSHIP-MANDATE.md, 310 bytes each) hold the stdout of a failed
--     wrangler download ("Downloading ... from qnfo-assets. Download complete."), not the decision. The rule enforced here is the one the fleet's own code states (the Zenodo attribution audit:
--     "sole human author = Rowan Brad Quni-Gudzinas; organizational bylines prohibited per ADR-014") and the docs quote ("attribution is always the individual").
--
-- What this adds (all additive; no existing trigger, view or row is changed):
--   * paper_ledger_chain: one row per paper_change_ledger row, in seq order: row_hash = sha256(previous row_hash + canonical JSON of the ledger row + the sha256 of the body it kept). A BEFORE INSERT
--     trigger accepts only the next ledger row (no gap, no repeat), the previous row's hash and a well formed hash; the table can never be updated or deleted. A worker (qnfo-lifecycle) writes the rows;
--     the hash is computed there because SQLite has no sha256. The head of the chain is anchored in a second database (qnfo-audit paper_ledger_seals), so rewriting this table alone is detected.
--   * v_paper_ledger_chain_breaks / v_paper_ledger_chain_body_breaks (two views: D1 rejects a compound SELECT over 5 terms) / v_paper_ledger_chain_status: the SQL-checkable part of the verification (link, genesis, a ledger row deleted or added below the head, a body added or an archive
--     fingerprint changed after sealing) and the sealing lag. The hash recomputation and the anchor comparison run in the worker.
--   * adr_enforcement + adr014_publish_audit + trg_papers_adr014_publish_ins / _upd: at publish (insert as published or distributed, or the first move into either from a non-public status, or an
--     authors change on a public paper) a paper whose authors do not name the owner is recorded in adr014_publish_audit (mode observe, the shipped default) or refused with ADR-014-AUTHORSHIP-BLOCKED
--     (mode enforce). Restores from quarantine, retraction or supersession are not first publications and are never recorded. 'off' skips the check.
--   * v_adr014_authorship_violations / v_adr014_authorship_status: the exact list, split into era 'since-adr' (first public on or after 2026-09-02, the date of the ADR objects in R2) and 'legacy'.
--
-- Rollback is the DROP list in the header. The publish check is stopped without a deploy by UPDATE adr_enforcement SET mode = 'off' WHERE rule = 'adr014-publish-authorship'
-- (and raised to enforce the same way).
