-- NORTH-STAR-MANAGERS-1 (2026-11-04, charter pillars autonomy, cost and reach; programs QNFO.OPS, QNFO.INFRA, QNFO.REACH, QNFO.RSCH, QNFO.PERSONAL).
-- Owner directive 2026-11-04: managers think in strategy, features and quality, not only bug fixes. Goals: people actually read the research, fleet AI cost inside USD 200-300 a month,
-- a fast simple control surface where the owner is asked for almost nothing.
-- WHAT WAS MEASURED (qnfo-audit 2026-11-04 17:00-18:00Z):
--  * The scoreboard is permanently red (94 of 297 metrics hit a trigger) and the managers rank focus by percent past threshold: v_program_focus_plan orders by breach_ratio DESC, so a
--    metric with threshold 0 and value 1512 (content_items_over_stage_sla) is rank 1 of QNFO.OPS and issues_unprobed_60m is rank 12. None of the owner's four goals has a trigger:
--    engaged_reader_sessions_7d has none, cost is judged by five overlapping metrics (workers_ai_cost_30d_usd 508, cost_usd_30d 740, fleet_cost_pace_30d_usd 1151, monthly_cost_run_rate_usd
--    1249, fleet_cost_run_rate_usd 799), dashboard load time is not measured at all.
--  * Manager agent spend: program-manager requests to the Cloudflare agent were 142 in the last 24 h (137 the day before). 115 of the 142 are lever reviews (fleet_tasks management-personas-c
--    lever-request): 332 in 7 days, 44 with a usable reply (13 percent), asked again every hour for the same metric until a reply parses (trigger 14606 doctor_taint_violations_24h: 29 asks in 7 days).
--  * Roadmap origination (ROADMAP-ORIGINATE-1): 13 proposals in 7 days, 17 in 14, 14 deployed. ops_config roadmap_originate = on and code_merge_trusted_sources holds
--    management-personas|ROADMAP-1: (both read live). The throttle is not the switch: rm-research counts ALL open ROADMAP-1 issues of the program against a limit of 3, and
--    session-filed items from 10-26 still sit open (QNFO.RSCH 3 of 3, QNFO.REACH 6, QNFO.INFRA 2, QNFO.OPS 2), so RSCH has asked nothing since 10-31 and REACH answers every day while
--    OPS and INFRA get a preface-only reply ("I will research the program's data before proposing") that rm-research counts as an answer and never asks again that day.
--  * Dashboard: the new dashboard-load journey (scripts/fleet_journeys.py, this change) measured fleet.qnfo.org/ 909 ms and /api/managers 3344 ms from the runner on 2026-11-04.
-- WHAT THIS CHANGES (all in D1, one switch per behaviour, no worker edited, no cron added because fleet_budget caps are breached):
--  (1) FOUR NORTH STAR MEASURES (north_star_measures, v_north_star_state): readers = ns_readers_engaged_per_day (engaged_reader_sessions_7d / 7, target >= 12, now 6.3) with
--      ns_ext_visits_per_paper_30d (external-referrer loads per paper, target >= 0.25, now 0.07); cost = ns_fleet_cost_usd_month (fleet-scope cost_daily, 7 day run rate x 30, target <= 300,
--      now 799; the Cloudflare meter, because ai_call_counters holds 37 percent of it; owner-direct provider spend is excluded); owner load = ns_owner_urgent_cards (open IDENTITY-BOUND
--      cards above severity low, target <= 2, now 3); reliability = ns_dashboard_load_ms_p75_24h (dashboard-load journey, target <= 3000, unmeasured until the first runner pass) with
--      runtime_verified_share_24h. Each has a trigger and a cause mapping below. Their program owners are in north_star_program.
--  (2) FOCUS: v_program_focus_plan puts North Star metric issues first, then drivers (north_star_links tier driver, and strategic roadmap items), then everything else in the old order, and
--      keeps demoted hygiene metrics last and at most north_star_hygiene_slots (2) per program. Slots: a program that owns a breached North Star measure gets north_star_slot_bonus (2) more.
--      A trigger issue of a North Star metric or driver is pinned to its owner program (ns-pin). A guard-kind metric never ranks as hygiene and ranks right after the North Star drivers. ops_config north_star_focus = off restores the old order.
--  (3) ROADMAP: rm-research asks for ONE strategic proposal with NORTHSTAR and PREDICT lines, counts only manager-originated open items against its limit of 3, and asks again (up to 3 times a day)
--      when the reply has no TITLE and code-anchor; rm-meta records the North Star and the prediction (roadmap_proposal_meta); rm-file puts them in the issue; the product plus flow carries the
--      same two lines. Metrics roadmap_proposals_7d, roadmap_strategic_proposals_7d and programs_without_strategic_proposal_7d (trigger: any program without a strategic proposal in 7 days).
--  (4) SPEND: lever-request skips demoted hygiene metrics, asks at most lever_per_trigger_daily (2) times a day per metric and lever_daily_cap (24) a day in all, North Star metrics first.
--      ops_config north_star_lever_gate = off restores the old asks. Ten metrics are reviewed in control_registry (ns-review:*): six demoted (applied), three retire recommendations (planned).
--  (5) KEEP OR REVERT: north_star_experiments north-star-managers-1 reads on 2026-11-11 and writes keep, partial or revert (revert switches (2) and (4) off when a guard metric worsened);
--      decision_log carries the prediction below and the verdict.
-- PREDICTIONS (decision_log): within 7 days (a) lever asks per day fall from 115 to 40 or fewer and manager agent requests from 142 to 60 or fewer, (b) at least 4 programs originate a strategic
-- proposal in a week (0 do now), (c) at least 25 percent of focus slots hold North Star linked issues (at baseline: see north_star_experiments.baseline), with no guard worse: metrics_in_breach not more
-- than 8 above baseline, open_agent_issues not 20 percent above, issue_wontfix_share_7d not 0.05 above, remediation_latest_pass_pct_7d not 5 points below. Falsifier: any guard worse, or
-- lever asks not below 35 percent of baseline, reads partial and opens a second window.

-- ---- the spend review: ten breached metrics with the least distinct owner value (control_registry, ns-review:*) ----------------------------------------------------
-- Rubric: a breached metric has little distinct owner value when another breached metric already says the same thing, when it is a count over other metrics, or when its target contradicts a
-- standing owner decision (research volume was cut on purpose). Spend is the lever-request asks of the last 7 days (one ask is about 3.3k neurons, workers-ai-real-spend memory 2026-11-04, an estimate).
-- demote = applied here by north_star_links tier hygiene (no lever asks, last in focus, at most 2 slots per program): the metric, its trigger and its issue stay and keep measuring.
-- remove = a retire recommendation only (disposition_state planned): a retirement is a separate migration with its own rollback line once the owner replacement has 7 days of data.
-- The three owner-directive metrics of ISSUE-SLA-2H-1 and ISSUE-AGE-24H-1 (open_agent_issues, issue_drain_ratio_24h, issues_over_24h_no_doer) are NOT demoted.
