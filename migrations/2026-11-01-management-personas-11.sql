-- MANAGEMENT-PERSONAS-11 / PERSONAL-METRIC-DOERS-1 (2026-11-01, charter pillar autonomy).
-- Renamed from -10: #5518 merged a different migration (LEGACY-PLUS-LEDGER-1, plus_ledger columns and the pl-ledger step) under that name and applied it, so this one,
-- which changes only the dg-request step, is a forward migration with its own backup table (the backup of -10 predates that change and would roll both back).
-- Extend DOER-ASSIGN-1 to QNFO.PERSONAL off-target metric issues. Migration 9 already
-- ranks these metrics worst-first; the request step excluded PERSONAL entirely.
-- Personal requests contain only the aggregate focus reason, not the issue title/body,
-- and remain barred from personal-* code targets and research stores.
-- SWITCHED OFF BY DEFAULT: the step reads ops_config personal_metric_doers (seeded 'off'; absent reads as off), so applying this changes nothing until the switch is 'on'.
-- Why: Copilot's review of the pull request (High severity) found that the aggregate-only bound lives in the prompt only. qnfo-agents runs every cf_agent_requests row with the
-- generic loop scope, whose fleet_sql tool can read the referenced issue's title and description, and the instance name carries the issue id. Turn the switch on only after the
-- consumer authorises by requester: a request whose requester is program-manager:QNFO.PERSONAL must get no fleet_sql, ops_call or Code Mode read of agent_issues text, direct or
-- through the sandbox (issue 5455). Stop it again without a deploy: INSERT OR REPLACE INTO ops_config (key, value) VALUES ('personal_metric_doers', 'off');
-- Prediction (once the switch is on): each eligible PERSONAL off-target focus metric without a doer is requested
-- in breach-rank order, within the existing age and per-tick caps.
-- Rollback: UPDATE fleet_tasks SET definition = (SELECT definition FROM bak_20261101_mp11_workflow WHERE id = 'management-personas'), version = version + 1 WHERE id = 'management-personas'
-- APPLY-BY: ci
-- DB: qnfo-audit
-- BACKUP: bak_20261101_mp11_workflow
