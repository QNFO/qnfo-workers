"""BP26-FORECAST-HYGIENE-1 collectors (2026-10-28, charter pillar research; agent_issues 1000337).

Two metrics read from the q08-signal D1 table q08_forecasts (q08-signal-engine):

  brier_rolling_90d                       mean Brier score of forecasts with status 'resolved' and resolved_at in the last 90 days (outcome 1 or 0,
                                          the score q08-signal-engine stored). Unknown with no resolved forecast. Under 20 resolved forecasts the
                                          note says the score is mostly noise, as the /forecasts page does; target < 0.25 (always saying 50% scores 0.25).
  forecast_resolution_criteria_complete   share of OPEN forecasts whose resolution text names a source, a date and an edge-case rule. PROXY: three
                                          text patterns (a URL or a reporting phrase; a date or "by <date/year/month>"; an if/unless/otherwise/void/
                                          ambiguous clause). It checks that the words are present, not that the criteria are good; a forecast the
                                          generator wrote to the 30-400 character rule can still fail it. Unknown with no open forecast.

Evidence rows carry the forecast id and which part is missing, never the claim text.
