"""BP26 source_liveness collector (2026-10-28, charter pillar research; agent_issues predicate BP26-CLAIM-LEDGER).

source_liveness: cited source URLs that resolve (or have an archived R2 copy) / all cited URLs, rolling 7 days; target >= 0.99.
Source: living-paper.paper_citations.cited_url (written by qnfo-research-exec), rows with created_at in the last 7 days, distinct https URLs.
Each sampled URL gets one HEAD (a GET when HEAD answers 403/405/501), redirects followed by hand, through ctx.http(external=True).
  - resolved: final status below 400.   - failed: status 400+ (not 401/403/429) or a transport error (timeout, TLS, DNS).
  - inconclusive: 401, 403, 429 (the site answered but gates robots): left out of numerator and denominator and counted in the note.
PROXY and limits: (1) SAMPLE, not census: at most SAMPLE distinct URLs per run (newest first) inside the run's time budget; the note says how many of
how many were checked. (2) The archived-R2-copy half of the definition has no source in the repository (no archive ledger), so a dead URL counts as
failed even if a copy exists: the value is a lower bound. (3) Alive is not correct: a page that resolves may no longer say what was cited. Unknown when
the table is unreadable, no URL was cited in the window, or every sampled URL was inconclusive; never zero.
Evidence rows carry the citing slug and the failure token only, no page content.
