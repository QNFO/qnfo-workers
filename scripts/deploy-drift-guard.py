"""deploy-drift-guard.py - repo<->live drift monitor (VERSION + CONTENT + DIRECTION).

ROOT CAUSE (why this exists):
  1. The canonical deploy (qnfo-ops POST /ops/deploy + the qnfo-fleet-control redeploy)
     fetches <dir>/deployed-current.worker.js -- NOT <dir>/worker.js (see mirror-guard.py).
     A monitor that reads worker.js measures the wrong artifact and false-reports.
  2. A worker with NO version constant is INVISIBLE to any version-based drift check
     (silent skip) -> the drift can never be seen or reconciled. Silent skips are the
     defect this tool refuses to allow.

CLASSES (no class is ever silently dropped):
  DRIFT            repo VERSION != live /health version  (reconcile required)
  CONTENT_DRIFT    repo artifact sha256 != live /content sha256 (after normalisation)
  NO_REPO_VERSION  worker is live but the repo has no version constant (source gap)
  NO_LIVE_VERSION  worker answers /health but omits a version field (live gap)
  NOT_DEPLOYED     genuinely absent: HTTP 404 AND not in the CF account script list
  NO_HEALTH_ROUTE  IS deployed, but https://<name>.q08.workers.dev/health 404s
  CRON_ONLY        IS deployed, /health 404s, AND the directory declares >=1 cron trigger
                   with NO HTTP surface (no routes / workers_dev / custom domain). A
                   scheduled-only worker has no HTTP surface by construction, so its
                   404 is not a monitoring gap (CRON_ONLY-2, issue #1402).
                   (workers.dev route disabled, or no /health route) -- NOT "not deployed"
  NOT_A_WORKER     the directory declares no worker config (no wrangler.toml/json/jsonc)
                   AND ships no worker artifact AND the name is absent from the CF script
                   list. Repo scaffolding / non-worker directories, reported separately so
                   they cannot inflate NOT_DEPLOYED (issue #1379).
  LIVE_ERR         /health unreachable or non-404 error
  SYNC             repo == live

NAME-RESOLUTION-1 (2026-09-29, FLEET-AUTOAUDIT false negatives):
  The repo DIRECTORY is not the worker name. `agent-orchestrator/wrangler.toml` declares
  `name = "qnfo-agent-orchestrator"`, which IS deployed and answers /health v1.1.0 -- while
  `agent-orchestrator.q08.workers.dev` is a host that never existed. Probing the directory
  name returned 404, and the worker was written as NOT_DEPLOYED. Measured on the first
  FLEET-AUTOAUDIT-1 run (2026-09-29 15:44:42Z): 112 rows, 76 NOT_DEPLOYED -- a 68%
  false-negative rate on the class that is supposed to mean "retired/never-deployed".
  The guard now resolves the probe target from wrangler.toml `name` (json/jsonc fallback,
  directory name as last resort) and cross-checks the CF API script list so that
  NO_HEALTH_ROUTE is never conflated with NOT_DEPLOYED. When the CF script list is
  unavailable (no token / API error) the guard degrades to the previous NOT_DEPLOYED
  reading and reports `cf_script_list: false` rather than guessing.
  Every directory still yields exactly one class -- the fix removes a false negative,
  it does not introduce a silent skip.

NOT-DEPLOYED-KEYED-BY-DIR-1 / NOT-DEPLOYED-NONWORKER-NOISE-1 (2026-09-29, issues
#1379/#1380): two residual defects in the class above.
  (a) KEYING: every other class emitted the RESOLVED worker name, but NOT_DEPLOYED emitted
      the raw repo DIRECTORY, so the consumer wrote `worker_live_audit.worker` values that
      are not worker names and cannot be joined against the CF account or the service
      registry. `not_deployed_workers` is now a list of {"worker","dir"} objects (the legacy
      bare-string list is still emitted as `not_deployed_dirs` so no consumer silently
      changes meaning).
  (b) NOISE: a directory with no worker config and no worker artifact is not a worker; the
      old code reported it as NOT_DEPLOYED purely because its name was absent from the
      account. Measured 2026-09-29: ~26% of the class. Such directories are now classed
      NOT_A_WORKER, which is reported and counted but never treated as a worker.
  `scope` is emitted in JSON ("all" | "narrative") so the consumer knows whether the run
  covered every directory and may therefore purge stale rows (issue #1378).

DIRECTION (2026-09-29, issue #1229): a version mismatch is not automatically "the repo
is right". The live bundle can be AHEAD of the repo (DEPLOY-UNLOGGED-MUTATION, issues
#1340-#1343, and the qnfo-lifecycle 1.6.2-cronconsolidate case). `--ahead` therefore
emits only the workers where the repo artifact is STRICTLY AHEAD of live by numeric
version comparison -- the only direction where redeploying the repo is safe. Anything
else is reported, never auto-applied. This is the machine-readable contract used by
.github/workflows/fleet-autodeploy.yml.
MULTI-VERSION-AHEAD-EXCLUSION-1 (issue 1457): an artifact that declares MORE THAN
ONE distinct plain VERSION cannot be direction-trusted at all -- `_repo_version()`
picks the last declaration (#1388), which is a heuristic about which binding
/health serves. Such a worker is reported as MULTI_VERSION and is NEVER emitted in
`--ahead`, so an ambiguous artifact can never drive an autodeploy downgrade.
MULTI_VERSION is reported but not counted in the exit code, on the same precedent
as NO_HEALTH_ROUTE and NOT_A_WORKER: it is an ambiguity in the monitor's input, not
a repo<->live divergence.

CONTENT MODE (--content): fetches the live bundle from the CF API /content endpoint and
compares a normalised sha256 against the repo canonical artifact. This closes the gap
called out in issue #1229 (content-level repo<->live drift is undetectable and the
fleet-wide check is continue-on-error). Requires CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN + CF_ACCOUNT_ID.
Content drift is REPORT-ONLY: it is never used to justify an auto-deploy on its own,
because a mirror capture can legitimately differ in formatting from a fresh build.

JSON MODE (--json): emits ONE line of JSON carrying the full membership of every class,
including `sync_workers` and `not_deployed_workers`. Counts alone are not auditable: a
consumer (scripts/fleet-autoaudit.py) must be able to write a row per worker, so every
class carries its worker names. Entries carry BOTH `worker` (the resolved CF script name,
the value that is actually probed) and `dir` (the repo directory), so a consumer cannot
confuse the two again.

Default scope = the narrative-generation surfaces we own. `--all` = all workers.
Exit: 0 clean (scoped: SYNC only) | 1 any DRIFT / CONTENT_DRIFT / NO_*_VERSION / LIVE_ERR
NO_HEALTH_ROUTE and NOT_A_WORKER are reported but deliberately NOT counted in the exit
code: a private worker with a disabled workers.dev route is not a repo<->live divergence,
and a non-worker directory is not a divergence at all -- making either blocking would turn
a monitoring gap into a fleet-wide CI outage.
