var VERSION = "1.43.0-paper-provenance-archive"; /* 1.42.1 OWNER-ADDRESS-HYGIENE-1 (2026-10-27): rwnqni@outlook.com is not a valid address and leaves LEARNER_OWNER_ADDRS. */ /* 1.42.0 GCP-INVENTORY-1 (2026-10-26, pillar reach; minor: a new read-only loop): hourly inventory of the Google Cloud project behind the GCP_SA_KEY secret (enabled APIs, the service account's roles) written as gcp-inventory events; POST /run?job=gcp-inventory forces a run. */ /* 1.41.1 DEGENERATE-TEXT-1b (2026-10-26, pillar research; patch): the fresh quality lane wrote nothing when its sweep failed before its own event (the tick ignores the return value), so a failure of the ten-minute gate would have been silent; it now records a quality-fresh error event. */ /* 1.41.0 DEGENERATE-TEXT-1 (2026-10-26, pillar research; minor: the publication sweep now withdraws a defined class on its own; owner 2026-10-26 "errors like this can never make it past review/publish gates"): paper qnf-d66c40b5 was public with an 8,171-token "Te Te Te" model loop and a 24,586-character wall of repeated text ahead of its Abstract and scored 100 (ok), because the score counts characters and nothing looked for repetition. pubGateScore now runs the deterministic DEGENERATE-TEXT detector (qnfo-cloud-ops/degenerate-text.mjs holds the same block; degenerate-text.test.mjs fails when they differ): 200 repeated tokens in one region or a 5% share is degenerate-text and the sweep withdraws that paper alone (status quarantined, ledgered with change_actor and change_reason, one batch each, at most 10 a run, an owner paper never), a shorter stutter is revise (quality:repetition), and the restore step keeps a still-degenerate paper quarantined. ops_config degenerate_text_withdraw = off turns the withdrawal into a revise without a deploy. A fresh lane (jobQualityFresh, every tick, POST /run?job=quality-fresh) gives the same verdicts to the papers published or changed in the last 90 minutes or never gated, so a paper any publish path just wrote is judged within about ten minutes. Measured on all 950 living-paper bodies before the change: one paper flagged (this one), no false positive.

Until the limit is crossed (about 44 MB held on 2026-10-26, growing about 1.1 MB an hour) the step only measures. 1.37.1 QUALITY-SCORE-MEMORY-1 (2026-10-26, pillar autonomy): the hourly quality sweep read every published paper body in one SELECT (about 40 MB at 1,000 papers) and kept the bodies again in its verdict list; Observability recorded exceededMemory at 2026-10-25T05:21:06Z, four seconds after a 693-paper sweep reported ok. Papers and the quarantines it restores are now read in keyset pages by rowid (QUALITY_SCORE_PAGE_ROWS = 10) and scored and written page by page; snapshots, verdicts and audit rows are unchanged, and a failed page write no longer stops the pages after it. 1.37.0 PAPER-LEDGER-1 (2026-10-26, pillar research and reach): the publication gate attributes the one change it makes that the living-paper revision ledger records, a restore from quarantine (papers.change_actor = qnfo-cloud-ops:<run id>, change_reason = the quarantine it undoes), so paper_change_ledger no longer files it as unattributed; verdict-only writes (release_gate_*) are not ledger events and stay in publication_gate_audit; the structure checker reads "1.0 Title" as section 1. 1.36.1 PUB-GATE-RESTORE-2 (2026-10-26, pillar research and reach): each quarantined paper is restored in its own batch; 11 of the 162 were refused by the living-paper publish floor (under 20,000 chars), and one refusal rolled back its 100-statement chunk and threw out of the run, so most restores never landed. A refusal is logged as publication_gate_audit decision restore-refused and the rest go through. 1.36.0 PUB-GATE-RESTORE-1 (2026-10-26, pillar research and reach): the publication gate sweep no longer withdraws any published paper (PUB-GATE-NO-WITHDRAW-1, owner 2026-10-26: no safety checks the owner did not ask for): failing papers are marked for revision and stay published, and every paper it quarantined for quality is restored. 1.33.2 RESEARCH-WATCHDOG-TIMEOUT-1 (2026-10-25, pillar autonomy, issue 3924): the watchdog aborted its forced stage after 90 s although a p99 stage takes about 10.5 minutes, so queued research stalled 120 minutes; the timeout is now 12 minutes, under the 14-minute research-exec lease and the 15-minute scheduled ceiling. */ /* 1.33.0 RESEARCH-WATCHDOG-1 (2026-10-20, pillar autonomy, agent_issues 2838 EVOLVE-1, SLA-AND-PATHS-1): qnfo-research-exec ran from one trigger, its own cron. Every tick now reads whether the research queue holds work and whether a stage finished in the last 30 minutes, and forces one stage through the new RESEARCH_EXEC service binding (POST /run?sync=1 on an internal host, the path qnfo-ops ops_research_kick uses) when work waits and nothing finished; it also forces one proof stage a day so the second path is exercised, not declared. OWNER-EXEMPT-METRIC-1 (agent_issues 1947): idea_topic_concentration_30d is computed over generated accepts only (a producer whose name holds owner is exempt from the diversity cap by design); the all-sources share rides in the job notes. Each forced stage leaves a cloud_ops_events row of kind research-watchdog; a busy answer (single-flight lease held) is a healthy run, not a failure. */ /* 1.32.1 INBOUND-SLA-GRACE-1 (2026-10-19, agent_issues 100063): the inbound SLA grace is 90 minutes (was 12 h), inside the 120-minute first-action SLA. */ /* 1.32.0 FLEET-GRAPH-CADENCE-1 (2026-10-19, pillar autonomy): the second path of FLEET-GRAPH-1. Every tick reads the last run of fleet-graph.yml (the fleet code + topology graph build, scripts/fleet_graph.mjs) and, when it is older than 60 minutes and no dispatch was sent inside that window, sends repository_dispatch fleet-graph-tick, reusing the pure PROBE-CADENCE-1 decision. Live drift outside git (a raw PUT, a dashboard edit) therefore reaches the graph within about 70 minutes while main is quiet; a push to main rebuilds it at once. State only, no run log per tick; a refused dispatch files FLEET-GRAPH-DISPATCH-1 once. */ /* 1.30.0 GH-TOKEN-WATCH-1 (2026-10-14, pillar autonomy): every 10-minute tick reads GET /rate_limit with GH_TOKEN (no quota used) and writes github_token_ok, github_token_expires_in_min (from the github-authentication-token-expiration header; 999999 when the token has no expiry) and github_api_remaining to metric_registry, state in scheduler_state gh_token_watch; triggers file an issue when the token is refused or expires within 20160 minutes, so the Cloudflare -> GitHub path never stops silently. */ /* 1.29.1 OUTREACH-LOOKUP-120M-1: the job-run row is runScheduledJob's own (no second event). */ /* 1.29.0 OUTREACH-LOOKUP-120M-1 (2026-10-14, pillar reach; owner directive: no SLA exceeds 120 minutes, root causes remediated at once): a new job outreach-lookup runs the email lookup for needs-email rows every 120 minutes, every day, and moves a found address to pending; it never sends.

Merged on top of 1.26.0 DRAFT-GROUNDING-1; both behaviours kept. */ /* 1.26.0 DRAFT-GROUNDING-1 (2026-10-12, agent_issues 2282 and 2272, pillar reach; member 0.5.6-folded): the inbound-mail drafter's prompt names no example subject and escalates anything that needs expertise, judgement, a decision, an opinion or a commitment; a mechanical check (ungroundedTerms) refuses any draft holding a name, number or date the inbound email does not contain, so it falls back to the fixed acknowledgement or a hold; a model-written closing is cut. SLA-GRACE-1 (agent_issues 2204): the grace before a hold, acknowledgement or answer is 12 h, was 24 h, which equalled the target of inbound_first_response_h_median_30d and held the median at 24.1 to 24.3. */ /* 1.24.2 NOZ-DOI-1 (2026-10-10): the weekly external-registry stats job, its slot and catch-up, and every report line about it are removed; the portfolio status and board items carry no DOI; the release card probe checks PyPI only. 1.24.1 1.24.1 NO-TOPIC-HARDCODE-1 (owner directive 2026-10-10): the daily research scan builds its arXiv lanes from the owner's accepted ideas in idea_proposals instead of a fixed query table; its extractor prompt names no topic and uses only the match list; the email triage prompt is unchanged because qnfo-email-orchestrator carries the same line (email-orch-fold parity). */ /* 1.24.0 PROBE-REVIEW-1 (2026-10-07, agent_issues 2112 PROBE-INDEPENDENCE-2, pillar autonomy, core rule 7): every tick reads up to two closing probes (remediation_contracts on open issues, d1-query, not the template ownership probes nor METRIC-TRIGGER probes) whose text it has not judged and asks one Workers AI model (gpt-oss-120b, then deepseek-v4-flash) whether the probe tests the issue's definition of done; self-confirming takes the contract out of the closing path (status probe-review-refused, which neither executor reads, and a note on the issue) until a rewrite is judged tests-dod or partial, which restores it. One verdict per probe text (cloud_ops_events probe-review-<class>-<sha12>), heartbeat probe-review-tick each tick, ops_config probe_review_enabled / probe_review_enforce (record) switches; guard probe_review_refused_share_7d. Sessions write the closing probes for their own fixes, and a probe that checks only that a change was made closes the issue whether or not its outcome arrived. */ /* 1.23.1 WORKERS-AI-ATTRIBUTION-2 (2026-10-07, pillar cost, agent_issues 2097): every env.AI.run of this worker is counted in ai_call_counters through __aiAttrEnv (the helper of scripts/ai-attr-env-patch.py, env rebound at the top of scheduled and fetch); its neurons were unattributed while workers_ai_attribution_coverage_pct read 36.2 against a threshold of 50. */ /* 1.23.0 PUB-GATE-LOOP-1 (2026-10-07, agent_issues 2105, pillar research): the daily quality-score sweep scores every published paper (it wrote only the first 200 of 466 and still reported ok, so 266 papers were never scored) and runs the publication gate on all of them: papers.release_gate_pass/at/reason are written for the first time, publication_gate_audit gets a row per changed verdict (the only earlier run was the one-off shadow-20261004), and a score under 25 quarantines the paper unless ops_config publication_gate_mode = shadow or the run would demote more than 20 (then none, degraded). 1.22.1 GRANT-GMAIL-UNGRADED-1 (2026-10-07, pillar autonomy): grant-followup grades only the mailboxes it holds a credential for; without GMAIL_PASS Gmail is reported (channels.gmail no-credential, gmail_graded false) but the run is ok when qnfo.org mail was read and issues filed, since the owner dismissed both Gmail cards (human_actions 42, 47) and OPEN-ACCESS-1 forbids asking for a token (the pattern of RADAR-CAP-GRADING-1); 10 degraded runs in a row had kept watchmaker_index at 2 on a step no one may ask for. A Gmail read that fails with the credential set still degrades the run. 1.22.0 1.22.0 PROBE-CADENCE-1 (2026-10-06, pillar autonomy; owner question 2026-10-06 "why do fleet probes only run as SQL against qnfo-audit"): every 10-minute tick reads the last run of remediation-consumer.yml, the only runner of runtime probes (runner-https on fleet hosts, plane D1s), and sends repository_dispatch remediation-tick when that run is older than 60 minutes; 98 of its last 100 runs were chained to pushes on main, so a quiet main stopped every runtime probe. State in scheduler_state probe_cadence; a dispatch the token may not send files PROBE-CADENCE-DISPATCH-1. 1.21.1 RADAR-CAP-GRADING-1 (2026-10-06, agent_issues 1641, pillar reach): the mention radar reports a source blocked by an external per-IP quota (capped:..., StackExchange on shared Workers egress, never answered since 2026-10-02) without grading it, so the run is ok when every readable source is; any other failure still degrades it; the owner card stackexchange-key (free stackapps key, STACKEXCHANGE_KEY var) tracks the blind spot and resolves itself on the first ok answer. 1.21.0 RESEARCH-SCAN-LANES-1 (2026-10-06, pillar research, docs/CODE-REACH-PROGRAM.md): the daily arXiv research scan runs three lanes, each its own query and quota (quantum-energy = RESEARCH_SCAN_QUERY unchanged, ai-agents-epistemics, formal-verification; 4/3/3 results, 2/2/1 idea_proposals: the same ten results, five proposals and one extractor call as before), each proposal names its lane, and the must-read prompt names the new lanes; the outreach criterion is unchanged. Lever for idea_topic_concentration_30d (0.596, breach > 0.50). OWNER-STEPS-WATCH-1: a read-only companion of the daily release-check slot resolves the CODE-REACH-1 owner cards ula-v2-1-post and code-release-pypi with evidence once their public results exist (QNFO/license v2.1 file; PyPI and external registry software records). 1.20.0 EMAIL-ORCH-FOLD-1 (agent_issues 1756, pillar core): qnfo-email-orchestrator runs here as the member emailOrchMod (0.5.4-folded) on the single tick at its old cadence; /email-orch/health serves its health; the EMAIL binding declares props.caller so the member's sends authenticate. 1.19.2 RADAR-SE-REASON-1 (agent_issues 1641, pillar reach): the mention radar's StackExchange failure note carries the API's error_name and error_message (the API answers HTTP 400 for every error class, so "http:400" on every run since 2026-10-02 named nothing while the same URL answers 200 from outside Cloudflare); a per-address throttle is reported as capped:<why>; an optional STACKEXCHANGE_KEY var (public stackapps key) is appended when set. 1.19.1 SIGNAL-INTAKE-QEC-1 + IDEA-TOPIC-METRIC-1 (#1947): the research scan admits QEC only with an energy angle (all 10 hits and all 5 accepted auto-scan proposals on 2026-10-05 were generic QEC), and a daily companion in the quality-score slot recomputes metric_registry idea_topic_concentration_30d, which had no producer; OUTREACH-REASON-LEAK-1 (#1875): the first-contact mail quoted outreach_queue.reason raw, so all 49 cold emails sent to 2026-10-05 read "(arXiv 2609.30069v1 — arxiv-radar widened: <title>)", an internal pipeline label in the owner's voice (STRATEGY 2.5 no internal jargon); it now names the paper by its title and arXiv id only (outreachWorkLine) and never echoes other reason text; LEARNER_TEMPLATE jpcub-first-v3 so the learner tells the two texts apart; 1.19.0 CRON-SINGLE-TRIGGER-1 (#1785): one ten-minute trigger and an in-code due table in Amsterdam time replace 21 per-slot cron triggers; 1.18.4 WORKER-HEALTH-PROBE-AUTH-1: the qnfo-ai chat probe goes through the QNFO_AI service binding (props caller, #1703) instead of an absent ROUTER_AUTH_KEY copy, a probe whose credential this worker lacks is skipped with its reason instead of failing the endpoint, one job-run row per run (was two); GMAIL-TRIAGE-UNCONFIGURED-1: gmail-triage without GMAIL_PASS is recorded as skipped, not error; 1.18.3 CATCHUP-1 (a stats-job week missed by the 2026-09-25..30 trigger outage or failed is re-run the next day from the release-check slot when stats table is older than 180h and no run started in 20h; no new cron) and REFUSAL-STOP-1 (a run whose first 20 record reads are all refused stops instead of sending ~300 more); JOB-REASON-1: a run that is not 'ok' may return reason, stored in its job-run row's meta (grant-followup names the unread mailbox, e.g. GMAIL_PASS unset); 1.18.2 UTF8-DEPLOY-1: GitHub contents decode and encode as UTF-8 (ghB64Text, ghTextB64); also redeploys this worker, whose out-of-office regexes were uploaded double-encoded; 1.18.1 LEARNER_AUTO_SUBJ_RX prefix made unambiguous (CodeQL js/redos: no exponential backtracking on repeated "\taw:"); 1.18.0 OUTREACH-TEMPLATE-V2: the first-contact mail calls QNFO "an independent research imprint" (STRATEGY 2.1; v1 said "a research collective", which section 5 gate 2 bans) and spells JPCUB; LEARNER_TEMPLATE jpcub-first-v2; OUTREACH-LEARNER-1 (docs/STRATEGY.md s6.4): Thompson-sampling allocation of the unchanged shared outreach cap over 6 topic x recipient-type segments, per-send reply outcomes and Beta posteriors in D1 (outreach_learner_sends, outreach_learner_arms), stop rule (>= 50 sends and < 1% positive), ops_config kill switch outreach_learner_enabled, daily tick (engagement slot) publishing outreach_reply_rate_30d and warm_conversations_30d; SENT-AS-YOU-DELIVERY-1: the daily digest is mailed to the owner's qnfo.org address through SEND_EMAIL, once a day; 1.17.1 UA-1 (stats-job sends an honest User-Agent; external registry refused the spoofed browser one with 403 from 2026-09-05) and EMAIL-TRIAGE-D1-1 (email triage reads and marks qnfo-audit.emails directly instead of through qnfo-email's EMAIL_API_KEY routes); 1.17.0 GRANT-FOLLOWUP-1 (replies before an application's handled_through date are recorded, not refiled): funder replies from qnfo.org mail and Gmail (read-only) become cloud_ops_events rows and agent_issues, in the worker-health slot (CRON_COMPANIONS); OUTREACH-OPTOUT-EVIDENCE-1, OUTREACH-CONSENT-1, OUTREACH-SHARED-CAP-1, SENT-AS-YOU-DIGEST-1, REGISTER-GUARD-FOLD-1; IDENTITY-WEEKLY-1 moved to qnfo-fleet-dashboard with the private store (IDENTITY-STORE-1) */ /* 1.31.0 SLA-120M-INBOUND-1 (2026-10-19, pillar autonomy, agent_issues 2583): inboundSlaMetrics also writes inbound_unactioned_120m (human inbound rows with no first fleet action after INBOUND_SLA.first_action_min = 120 minutes) and runs on the 15-minute member tick instead of the 3-hourly one;

SLA-GRACE-1 (agent_issues 2204): the grace before a hold, acknowledgement or answer is 12 h, was 24 h, which equalled the target of inbound_first_response_h_median_30d and held the median at 24.1 to 24.3. */ /* 1.24.2 NOZ-DOI-1 (2026-10-10): the weekly external-registry stats job, its slot and catch-up, and every report line about it are removed; the portfolio status and board items carry no DOI; the release card probe checks PyPI only. 1.24.1 1.24.1 NO-TOPIC-HARDCODE-1 (owner directive 2026-10-10): the daily research scan builds its arXiv lanes from the owner's accepted ideas in idea_proposals instead of a fixed query table; its extractor prompt names no topic and uses only the match list; the email triage prompt is unchanged because qnfo-email-orchestrator carries the same line (email-orch-fold parity). */ /* 1.24.0 PROBE-REVIEW-1 (2026-10-07, agent_issues 2112 PROBE-INDEPENDENCE-2, pillar autonomy, core rule 7): every tick reads up to two closing probes (remediation_contracts on open issues, d1-query, not the template ownership probes nor METRIC-TRIGGER probes) whose text it has not judged and asks one Workers AI model (gpt-oss-120b, then deepseek-v4-flash) whether the probe tests the issue's definition of done; self-confirming takes the contract out of the closing path (status probe-review-refused, which neither executor reads, and a note on the issue) until a rewrite is judged tests-dod or partial, which restores it. One verdict per probe text (cloud_ops_events probe-review-<class>-<sha12>), heartbeat probe-review-tick each tick, ops_config probe_review_enabled / probe_review_enforce (record) switches; guard probe_review_refused_share_7d. Sessions write the closing probes for their own fixes, and a probe that checks only that a change was made closes the issue whether or not its outcome arrived. */ /* 1.23.1 WORKERS-AI-ATTRIBUTION-2 (2026-10-07, pillar cost, agent_issues 2097): every env.AI.run of this worker is counted in ai_call_counters through __aiAttrEnv (the helper of scripts/ai-attr-env-patch.py, env rebound at the top of scheduled and fetch); its neurons were unattributed while workers_ai_attribution_coverage_pct read 36.2 against a threshold of 50. */ /* 1.23.0 PUB-GATE-LOOP-1 (2026-10-07, agent_issues 2105, pillar research): the daily quality-score sweep scores every published paper (it wrote only the first 200 of 466 and still reported ok, so 266 papers were never scored) and runs the publication gate on all of them: papers.release_gate_pass/at/reason are written for the first time, publication_gate_audit gets a row per changed verdict (the only earlier run was the one-off shadow-20261004), and a score under 25 quarantines the paper unless ops_config publication_gate_mode = shadow or the run would demote more than 20 (then none, degraded). 1.22.1 GRANT-GMAIL-UNGRADED-1 (2026-10-07, pillar autonomy): grant-followup grades only the mailboxes it holds a credential for; without GMAIL_PASS Gmail is reported (channels.gmail no-credential, gmail_graded false) but the run is ok when qnfo.org mail was read and issues filed, since the owner dismissed both Gmail cards (human_actions 42, 47) and OPEN-ACCESS-1 forbids asking for a token (the pattern of RADAR-CAP-GRADING-1); 10 degraded runs in a row had kept watchmaker_index at 2 on a step no one may ask for. A Gmail read that fails with the credential set still degrades the run. 1.22.0 1.22.0 PROBE-CADENCE-1 (2026-10-06, pillar autonomy; owner question 2026-10-06 "why do fleet probes only run as SQL against qnfo-audit"): every 10-minute tick reads the last run of remediation-consumer.yml, the only runner of runtime probes (runner-https on fleet hosts, plane D1s), and sends repository_dispatch remediation-tick when that run is older than 60 minutes; 98 of its last 100 runs were chained to pushes on main, so a quiet main stopped every runtime probe. State in scheduler_state probe_cadence; a dispatch the token may not send files PROBE-CADENCE-DISPATCH-1. 1.21.1 RADAR-CAP-GRADING-1 (2026-10-06, agent_issues 1641, pillar reach): the mention radar reports a source blocked by an external per-IP quota (capped:..., StackExchange on shared Workers egress, never answered since 2026-10-02) without grading it, so the run is ok when every readable source is; any other failure still degrades it; the owner card stackexchange-key (free stackapps key, STACKEXCHANGE_KEY var) tracks the blind spot and resolves itself on the first ok answer. 1.21.0 RESEARCH-SCAN-LANES-1 (2026-10-06, pillar research, docs/CODE-REACH-PROGRAM.md): the daily arXiv research scan runs three lanes, each its own query and quota (quantum-energy = RESEARCH_SCAN_QUERY unchanged, ai-agents-epistemics, formal-verification; 4/3/3 results, 2/2/1 idea_proposals: the same ten results, five proposals and one extractor call as before), each proposal names its lane, and the must-read prompt names the new lanes; the outreach criterion is unchanged. Lever for idea_topic_concentration_30d (0.596, breach > 0.50). OWNER-STEPS-WATCH-1: a read-only companion of the daily release-check slot resolves the CODE-REACH-1 owner cards ula-v2-1-post and code-release-pypi with evidence once their public results exist (QNFO/license v2.1 file; PyPI and external registry software records). 1.20.0 EMAIL-ORCH-FOLD-1 (agent_issues 1756, pillar core): qnfo-email-orchestrator runs here as the member emailOrchMod (0.5.4-folded) on the single tick at its old cadence; /email-orch/health serves its health; the EMAIL binding declares props.caller so the member's sends authenticate. 1.19.2 RADAR-SE-REASON-1 (agent_issues 1641, pillar reach): the mention radar's StackExchange failure note carries the API's error_name and error_message (the API answers HTTP 400 for every error class, so "http:400" on every run since 2026-10-02 named nothing while the same URL answers 200 from outside Cloudflare); a per-address throttle is reported as capped:<why>; an optional STACKEXCHANGE_KEY var (public stackapps key) is appended when set. 1.19.1 SIGNAL-INTAKE-QEC-1 + IDEA-TOPIC-METRIC-1 (#1947): the research scan admits QEC only with an energy angle (all 10 hits and all 5 accepted auto-scan proposals on 2026-10-05 were generic QEC), and a daily companion in the quality-score slot recomputes metric_registry idea_topic_concentration_30d, which had no producer; OUTREACH-REASON-LEAK-1 (#1875): the first-contact mail quoted outreach_queue.reason raw, so all 49 cold emails sent to 2026-10-05 read "(arXiv 2609.30069v1 — arxiv-radar widened: <title>)", an internal pipeline label in the owner's voice (STRATEGY 2.5 no internal jargon); it now names the paper by its title and arXiv id only (outreachWorkLine) and never echoes other reason text; LEARNER_TEMPLATE jpcub-first-v3 so the learner tells the two texts apart; 1.19.0 CRON-SINGLE-TRIGGER-1 (#1785): one ten-minute trigger and an in-code due table in Amsterdam time replace 21 per-slot cron triggers; 1.18.4 WORKER-HEALTH-PROBE-AUTH-1: the qnfo-ai chat probe goes through the QNFO_AI service binding (props caller, #1703) instead of an absent ROUTER_AUTH_KEY copy, a probe whose credential this worker lacks is skipped with its reason instead of failing the endpoint, one job-run row per run (was two); GMAIL-TRIAGE-UNCONFIGURED-1: gmail-triage without GMAIL_PASS is recorded as skipped, not error; 1.18.3 CATCHUP-1 (a stats-job week missed by the 2026-09-25..30 trigger outage or failed is re-run the next day from the release-check slot when stats table is older than 180h and no run started in 20h; no new cron) and REFUSAL-STOP-1 (a run whose first 20 record reads are all refused stops instead of sending ~300 more); JOB-REASON-1: a run that is not 'ok' may return reason, stored in its job-run row's meta (grant-followup names the unread mailbox, e.g. GMAIL_PASS unset); 1.18.2 UTF8-DEPLOY-1: GitHub contents decode and encode as UTF-8 (ghB64Text, ghTextB64); also redeploys this worker, whose out-of-office regexes were uploaded double-encoded; 1.18.1 LEARNER_AUTO_SUBJ_RX prefix made unambiguous (CodeQL js/redos: no exponential backtracking on repeated "\taw:"); 1.18.0 OUTREACH-TEMPLATE-V2: the first-contact mail calls QNFO "an independent research imprint" (STRATEGY 2.1; v1 said "a research collective", which section 5 gate 2 bans) and spells JPCUB; LEARNER_TEMPLATE jpcub-first-v2; OUTREACH-LEARNER-1 (docs/STRATEGY.md s6.4): Thompson-sampling allocation of the unchanged shared outreach cap over 6 topic x recipient-type segments, per-send reply outcomes and Beta posteriors in D1 (outreach_learner_sends, outreach_learner_arms), stop rule (>= 50 sends and < 1% positive), ops_config kill switch outreach_learner_enabled, daily tick (engagement slot) publishing outreach_reply_rate_30d and warm_conversations_30d; SENT-AS-YOU-DELIVERY-1: the daily digest is mailed to the owner's qnfo.org address through SEND_EMAIL, once a day; 1.17.1 UA-1 (stats-job sends an honest User-Agent; external registry refused the spoofed browser one with 403 from 2026-09-05) and EMAIL-TRIAGE-D1-1 (email triage reads and marks qnfo-audit.emails directly instead of through qnfo-email's EMAIL_API_KEY routes); 1.17.0 GRANT-FOLLOWUP-1 (replies before an application's handled_through date are recorded, not refiled): funder replies from qnfo.org mail and Gmail (read-only) become cloud_ops_events rows and agent_issues, in the worker-health slot (CRON_COMPANIONS); OUTREACH-OPTOUT-EVIDENCE-1, OUTREACH-CONSENT-1, OUTREACH-SHARED-CAP-1, SENT-AS-YOU-DIGEST-1, REGISTER-GUARD-FOLD-1; IDENTITY-WEEKLY-1 moved to qnfo-fleet-dashboard with the private store (IDENTITY-STORE-1) */

// CRON-SINGLE-TRIGGER-1 (2026-10-02, #1785, pillar: core). The worker used to register one Cloudflare cron trigger per
// AMS_SCHEDULE slot (21 expressions, rebuilt and PUT again at every daylight-saving change). The account held 84
// expressions against the fleet budget of 50, and on 2026-09-25 the whole list was removed live and every weekly job
// stopped unseen. There is now ONE trigger, TICK_CRON, and each tick asks the table below which jobs are due in
// Amsterdam local time, so the trigger list never changes again (no offset re-sync, nothing to drift).
// The tick is every 10 minutes, the fastest the owner's CRON-RATE-CEILING-1 allows (scripts/cron_rate_guard.py: no cron
// closer than 10 minutes, at most 144 fires a day). The table keeps its 5-minute slots: a job on a :05 or :15 mark runs

/* IDEA-TOPIC-METRIC-1 (1.19.1, #1947): metric_registry idea_topic_concentration_30d (trigger: > 0.50) was written once by
   hand on 2026-10-04 (0.588) and had no producer, so its trigger state could never change. This daily companion recomputes
   it from qnfo-audit.idea_proposals: the share of ACCEPTed items in the last 30 days that fall in the largest keyword
   cluster. The classifier reproduces the registration's reading (a "quantum" cluster over name, idea and rationale: 30/51
   on 10-04, 31/52 on 10-05) and checks "quantum" first, so a quantum-thermodynamics item still counts as quantum and the
   number cannot fall by re-labelling. Read-only except the one registry row; no model call.
   Since 1.28.0 (TOPIC-CLUSTERS-DERIVED-1, ACCURACY-FLEET-2a, agent_issues 2281) the clusters are no fixed table: the job
   re-derives them from the accepted ideas (shared block below), writes them to ops_config idea_topic_clusters and reads each
   row's idea text with them; migrations/2026-10-13-topic-clusters-derived.sql records the old and new definitions. */

// ACCURACY-FLEET-2a (agent_issues 2281; owner directive 2026-10-10: no topic or noun may be hard-coded in instructions) retires
// the fixed four-cluster keyword table IDEA_TOPIC_CLUSTERS. The topic clusters are derived from data: the ACCEPTed
// idea_proposals of the last TOPIC_DERIVE_DAYS days (the owner's own ideas, the owner-corpus notes and the accepted generated
// proposals), over the idea text only, by a deterministic rule:
//   1. terms: lower-cased, accents removed, split on anything but a-z and 0-9; words of 4+ characters that do not start with a
//      digit and are not in TOPIC_STOPWORDS (English function words and research-process words; it names no subject); plurals
//      folded (ies -> y, a final s after a letter other than s or u dropped).
//   2. template terms: a term in at least TOPIC_TEMPLATE_SHARE of one producer's texts (producer = idea_proposals.name with at
//      least TOPIC_TEMPLATE_MIN_DOCS texts) is that producer's boilerplate and is dropped.
//   3. candidates: the TOPIC_CANDIDATES terms with the highest document frequency (at least TOPIC_MIN_DF), ties alphabetical.
//   4. grouping: in that order a term joins the cluster whose seed it co-occurs with most (earliest seed on a tie) when at least
//      TOPIC_JOIN of its texts carry that seed (up to TOPIC_CLUSTER_TERMS terms a cluster); otherwise it seeds a new cluster
//      (at most 3 x TOPIC_CLUSTER_MAX seeds).
//   5. a seed no other term joined is a generic word, not a topic, and is dropped; the first TOPIC_CLUSTER_MAX remaining
//      clusters in seed-frequency order are kept, each labelled by its seed.
// A text belongs to the first cluster (largest seed first, as the old table checked its largest cluster first) that shares a
// term with it, else to "other". No data gives no clusters: every text is "other", the diversity cap holds nothing and the
// metric is not written; there is no fallback topic list. The derivation is cached in ops_config idea_topic_clusters:

/* OUTREACH-LEARNER-1 (2026-10-02, pillar: reach; owner directive 2026-10-02: the fleet measures its external
   effectiveness and changes itself to improve it; docs/STRATEGY.md s6.4 outreach loop and s6.3 "warm conversations").
   The loop the strategy specified ("reply rate by segment and template moves the daily cap toward the segments that
   answer; any segment under 1% after 50 sends stops") was not built: jobOutreach drained outreach_queue oldest first.
   - Segment = topic x recipient type, 6 arms, from data every candidate carries. Topic comes from the paper title in
     outreach_queue.reason (radar-hub's keyword classes): "energy" (thermodynamics, Landauer, batteries, heat: pillar 1
     directly), "qec" (error correction without energy), "other". Recipient type comes from the address domain:
     "personal" (webmail) or "institutional". The first-contact template is fixed (LEARNER_TEMPLATE, recorded per send),
     so it is not a dimension until a second variant exists.
   - Outcome per first-contact send (outreach_learner_sends, one row per outreach_queue id, backfilled from history):
     a reply is an inbound qnfo-audit.emails row from the same address (SRS and BATV wrappers removed) or carrying our
     Message-ID in In-Reply-To/References, received after the send. Auto-replies are ignored (Auto-Submitted, X-Autoreply,
     out-of-office wording). "optout" = a STOP / unsubscribe reply (also written to email_suppression); "negative" = a
     decline ("not interested", "I don't see any connection"); "positive" = any other human reply; "bounce" = a delivery
     failure naming the address (also suppressed); "no-reply" after 21 days (a later reply still upgrades it).
   - Posterior per segment: Beta(1 + positives, 1 + optout + negative + bounce + no-reply), persisted in
     outreach_learner_arms and recomputed from the ledger on every update (idempotent); every change is logged as a
     cloud_ops_events 'ol-post-*' row with the sends that moved it.
   - Allocation: per slot, a Thompson draw for every segment with candidates picks the segment, its oldest candidate takes
     the slot. A row whose address is not known yet (arXiv lookup pending) draws the best of its topic's live arms. The
     caps are untouched: the existing loop still applies 8/day shared, 3/day per domain, suppression and dedupe to
     whatever order it receives, so the learner can change who is mailed, never how many. Each run logs 'ol-alloc-*'.
   - Stop rule: a segment with >= 50 sends and positives < 1% of sends is stopped; its candidates are held
     (outreach_queue status 'held-segment-stopped', out of the drain selector, reversible) and its follow-ups skipped.
     ops_config 'outreach_learner_resume:<segment>' = 1 overrides it; held rows are released when a segment runs again.
   - Kill switch: ops_config 'outreach_learner_enabled' (absent = on; 0/off = the previous oldest-first order over 25
     rows, and held rows are released). An unreadable ops_config also falls back to oldest-first and changes no hold.
   - Daily tick (job outreach-learner, a companion in the daily engagement slot; no new cron): backfill, outcomes,
     posteriors, stop rule, metrics outreach_reply_rate_30d and warm_conversations_30d into metric_registry, and a
     heartbeat 'ol-tick-<day>' that WATCHMAKER_OPS (qnfo-fleet-dashboard, key outreach-learner) reads. */

// section 7 and a skipped section 6. Deterministic structure and residue checks now demote those papers independent of the
// coarse score; the sweep remains a second line for already-published papers.
// PUB-GATE-LOOP-1 (1.23.0, agent_issues 2105, pillar research): the publication gate is an hourly step of this sweep;
// quality_scores remains one snapshot per paper per UTC day.
// Before it, the only gate run was one hand-run shadow pass (living-paper.publication_gate_audit run_id shadow-20261004,
// 464 rows in 16 seconds, never repeated; papers.release_gate_* never written by anything), and the sweep scored only the
// first 200 of 466 published papers (stmts.slice(0, 200)) while reporting ok, so 266 papers never had a score and 28 of
// them were "demoted" for having none. Now every published paper is scored (batches of PUB_GATE_CHUNK), each gets a
// verdict in papers.release_gate_pass / release_gate_at / release_gate_reason, and publication_gate_audit gets a row
// whenever a paper's verdict changes. Verdicts: pass (score >= 50); revise (25..49, "thin": stays published with
// release_gate_pass 0 and a reason naming what is missing); demote (< 25, "quarantine-candidate"): status -> quarantined
// when ops_config publication_gate_mode is enforce (the default; 'shadow' records without acting). A run that would demote
// more than PUB_GATE_MAX_DEMOTES score-only papers quarantines none of those and reports degraded; deterministic content
// failures still quarantine (a broken coarse scorer must not empty the site).
// PUB-GATE-RESTORE-1 (1.36.0, 2026-10-26, pillar research and reach): v2 quarantined 364 published papers from 17:00 to 20:00Z on
// 2026-10-25 (papers sitemap 470 -> 348, metric indexed_surface). 69 of them were the owner's own imported papers (qnfo-2025-*), which the
// fleet never rewrites or withdraws; 200 failed only on heading style: a "## 2.1" subsection under a section written as "# 2" or left
// unnumbered (subsection-without-section-N), a reading defect, not a reader-facing one. Now (v3): subsection-without-section is a soft
// issue that never demotes; an owner paper is never demoted for structure or score (it gets revise with the reason); prompt residue and
// internal artifacts still demote everywhere. Each run restores up to PUB_GATE_MAX_CHANGES papers this gate quarantined (reason
// "quality:...") whose verdict is no longer demote, with a publication_gate_audit row (decision restore).
// PUB-GATE-NO-WITHDRAW-1 (1.36.0, same day; owner 2026-10-26: no "safety checks" the owner did not ask for): the sweep no longer
// withdraws any published paper. Every failing verdict becomes revise (release_gate_pass 0 with the reason, read first by the revision
// loop), and every paper an earlier version quarantined for quality is restored in one run, without a per-run cap. The mass-demote
// guard and the per-run change cap went with the withdrawal they guarded. ops_config publication_gate_mode no longer changes anything.
// DEGENERATE-TEXT-1 (1.41.0, 2026-10-26, pillar research; owner 2026-10-26: "errors like this can never make it past review/publish gates"):
// paper qnf-d66c40b5 (Passive Fault Tolerance via Bruhat-Tits Tree Codes) was public with an 8,171-token "Te Te Te" loop and a 24,586-character
// wall of repeated "The paper is written in LaTeTe" ahead of its Abstract, and the gate scored it 100 (ok): the score counts characters, so a
// loop raises it, and no check looked for repetition. The detector is the DEGENERATE-TEXT block below (qnfo-cloud-ops/degenerate-text.mjs holds the
// same text; degenerate-text.test.mjs fails when they differ). Over the 950 papers in living-paper on 2026-10-26 it flagged this paper and no other.
// Verdicts: a region of 200 tokens or a 5% share is degenerate-text and WITHDRAWS the paper (status quarantined, ledgered, one batch each, at most
// DEGEN_WITHDRAW_MAX a run; the rest wait for the next run as revise and the run reports degraded), because publishing a model loop is worse than
// an absence; a shorter stutter is revise (quality:repetition). An owner paper (qnfo-2025-*) is never withdrawn. The restore step below leaves a

// BREACH-DOCTOR-1 runs in qnfo-fleet-control on the */10 slot and writes its own metrics, so a stalled fleet-control tick or a stalled doctor block would stop the doctor and
// the numbers that report it together (spof_registry "breach doctor tick (qnfo-fleet-control */10)"; ANTIFRAGILE-1: a single executor on a critical path ships with its second
// path). This is that path, the RESEARCH-WATCHDOG-1 shape on a different worker and a different cron: on every tick it reads the doctor's newest 'tick' event in
// breach_diagnosis_events, writes doctor_tick_age_min from it (so the metric is measured by a second worker), and when the age passes 30 minutes files one deduped issue
// "BREACH-DOCTOR-1: doctor stalled (watch)" with a d1-query contract (tick age <= 15 minutes) that the existing remediation flow closes on recovery.
// Bounds: no model call; four D1 calls at most per run while it only watches (one read, the metric update, one atomic batch of issue + contract + event when it files, or the heartbeat row); one issue
// per 120 minutes (SLA-120M-1: the stall window is 30 minutes, the filing gap 120); single flight inside the isolate and, across isolates, in the SQL guards of the INSERTs.
// 1.40.0 BREACH-DOCTOR-WATCH-2 (agent_issues 1000397, pillar autonomy; minor: a decision the job now takes on its own): the acting half. The detect-and-report half above notices a stall and the diagnosis path still had one
// runner. Now, when doctor_tick_age_min is above 30 and ops_config breach_doctor is not off, the job calls POST /breach-doctor/run on qnfo-fleet-control through the FLEET_CONTROL service binding (props.caller
// qnfo-cloud-ops, no secret): the engine runs once in its own invocation, with its own validators, loop_lock and live-case index, so the starved or crashed */10 slot of that worker (the 2026-10-26 SQLITE_NOMEM
// heartbeat outage) no longer stops the diagnosis path. Nothing of the engine is copied here (a second validator would drift: the first was patched three times in one day). At most one call per 30 minutes: the
// call is claimed first by an INSERT of a run row (id breach-doctor-watch-run-s-<ms>, guarded by NOT EXISTS over the rows of the last 30 minutes, so two isolates cannot both call and an isolate that dies mid-call still

// text: tests-dod, partial or self-confirming. A self-confirming probe leaves the closing path (contract status
// probe-review-refused, which neither executor reads, plus a note on the issue); the orphan guard (v_issues_no_next_action)
// then surfaces the issue until the probe is rewritten, and a rewrite judged tests-dod or partial is put back to active.
// One verdict per probe text (cloud_ops_events probe-review-<class>-<sha12>), so a model call happens only when a probe
// changes; three unreadable replies leave the probe as it is (recorded). ops_config probe_review_enabled off stops the job;

// external_mentions was never written. Three of its causes were defects, not an absence of mentions:
//   - HN used tags=comment,story. Algolia treats a comma as AND, so it asked for items that are both a comment and a
//     story, which can never match. It now uses tags=(story,comment), plus a url search for qnfo.org.
//   - lobste.rs /search.json returns 400 "Unpermitted query or form parameter". The radar now reads the domain feed
//     /domains/qnfo.org.rss, where 404 means the domain was never submitted and counts as 0, not as an error.
//   - Every fetch error was swallowed, so a dead source looked like "no mentions".
// The fix:
//   - Each source's outcome is reported in notes.sources as ok:<n>, http:<status> or error:<msg>.
//   - Algolia is typo-tolerant and matches inside tokens (a YouTube id "QnfOOoTOrDE" was a hit), so only hits with "qnfo"
//     as a whole word are kept.
//   - OpenAlex citations stay in citation_stats; the credibility metric counts citation growth separately, so the radar
//     does not duplicate citation-feed rows as external mentions.
// RADAR-CITATION-SEPARATION-1 (1.42.4, agent_issues 1838, pillar reach): citation feeds are not third-party mention events.

// from outside Cloudflare) said nothing. The failure note now carries error_name and error_message; a throttle (Workers
