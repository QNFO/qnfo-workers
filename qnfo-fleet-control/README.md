# qnfo-fleet-control

Canonical source for the merged fleet-control hub worker (advisors + calibrator + deploy/drift).

- Deploy method: Cloudflare API `PUT /accounts/{acct}/workers/scripts/qnfo-fleet-control/content`
  with multipart `metadata={main_module:"worker.js"}` + `worker.js` part **including filename="worker.js"**.
  This preserves all 23 existing bindings (verified 2026-09-12).
- Do NOT deploy via wrangler: it would drop the script-API-managed bindings (BINDING-PRESERVATION-1).
- Deployed version: 0.4.11 (qnfo-fleet-deploy / drift scanner).

## 2026-09-12 change (self-heal wiring)
`scan()` now writes a row to `self_heal_actions` (qnfo-audit D1) for every
`drifted` / `stale-canon` / `health-ver` finding, with a `status`
(healed|failed|deferred|detected) and `verified_at`. Replaces a count-and-skip
path that re-observed the same unhealed problems every cycle.
