"""BP26-CFAPI-1 collectors (2026-10-26, charter pillars core, cost, autonomy; agent_issues 1000351 AI Gateway budgets, 1000352 gradual deploys, 1000353 durable jobs,
1000354 observability, 1000358 agent change gates).

The runner half of nine BP26 metrics whose input is the Cloudflare API, the GitHub API or the fleet's own ledgers. Run by scripts/bp26_producers.py from the remediation-consumer job.
Every value is measured; a collector that cannot measure returns None and writes nothing (unknown is never a value). Nothing is written to Cloudflare or GitHub: reads only.

  collect_deploys       deploys_via_gradual, change_failure_rate, mttr_rollback_min_p95
        The Workers Deployments API lists only the latest 10 deployments of a script, so each run stores the ones it sees in qnfo-audit.bp26_deploy_events (INSERT of new ids only) and
        the 30-day figures are computed from that table: the window GROWS from the first run, and the note says how many deployments and how many days it holds. A deployment is gradual
        when it splits traffic over more than one version or serves a version below 100 percent. A deployment FAILED when the next deployment of the same worker, within 24 h, is a
        rollback: annotated workers/triggered_by = rollback by Cloudflare, or a re-activation of a version that was live before the failed one. A canary revert of the control plane
        (an agent_issues row CONTROL-PLANE-REVERTED-1 naming the worker, created inside that worker's recorded window) counts as one failed deployment too. mttr_rollback_min_p95 is
        the p95 of minutes from the failed deployment to its rollback deployment: detection time is recorded nowhere, so this is an upper bound; with fewer than 5 rollbacks it is None.
  collect_ai_gateway    gateway_coverage, ai_cache_hit_rate
        Cloudflare GraphQL over 7 days. ai_cache_hit_rate = cached / all AI Gateway requests (the gateway log has no flag for a deterministic route, so the all-routes rate understates the
        rate on deterministic routes). gateway_coverage = gateway requests / (gateway requests + Workers AI inferences that bypassed the gateway), the second term being Workers AI
        inferences minus the non-cached Workers AI requests the gateway logged. A provider called directly from a Worker (not Workers AI) leaves no trace in Cloudflare: the figure is an
        upper bound and the note says so.
  collect_queues        dlq_depth
        Cloudflare Queues API: every dead-letter queue named by a consumer, its backlog and oldest message. The value is the backlog of DLQs whose oldest message is older than 120 minutes
        (an upper bound: the API cannot split the backlog by age). A queue consumer WITHOUT a dead-letter queue discards its failures: it is listed in the rows and the note, never hidden.
  collect_side_effects  duplicate_side_effects
        qnfo-audit ledgers, last 7 days: social_media_posts (the same platform id, buffer id or url recorded twice), social_threads (the same post_uri twice, identical thread text
        posted twice within 24 h) and emails status sent (same recipient, subject and body twice within 24 h). social_media_posts.content_preview is a label, not the text, so identical-text
        posts that did not share a platform id cannot be detected there, and the note says so.
  collect_log_ingest    log_ingest_gb_month
        No Cloudflare API reports the bytes Workers Logs ingested: the run asks the two candidate endpoints and records their answers; the value stays None until one answers.
  collect_ci_gate       ci_gate_bypass_count
        Merged pull requests of the last 30 days whose required checks (scripts/github-main-ruleset.json: gate, guard, mirror-guard, identity-guard) were not all green on the head commit,
        read from GitHub REST with a call budget per run (the consume job sends no token: 60 requests an hour) and kept in qnfo-audit.ci_gate_audit, so the audited set grows run by run.
        The value is the count among audited merges; it is None while the count is 0 and fewer than 98 percent of the window's merges are audited (a lower bound of 0 is not a measurement).
        The main-gate ruleset with those required checks is declared but NOT applied (GitHub enforces only main-safety: no deletion, no force push), and the stale-PR lane merges without
        the gate job by design: both are counted as the data shows them.
