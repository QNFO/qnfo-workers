--   done by a sibling probe coverage (RM-PROBE-VERIFIED-COVERAGE-1, PR 7306: 36 of 36 live workers declare probes.json, allowlist empty)

-- that the row reaches 43 minutes after filing. Filed with its doer (RM-KAIZEN-SCHEDULED-1.2); qnfo-fleet-control/worker.js was under another session claim (D1-observability) while this was written.
-- PREDICTION (decision_log): kaizen_candidates rows left scheduled 11 to 0 (10 resolved, 1 promoted); fleet_improvements rows filed per hour for the content-signal title 1 to 0 once the fix lands.
-- Falsifier: a resolved row whose cited enforcer is gone (the evidence names each so it can be re-read). Revert: the Rollback line restores status and evidence from bak_20261105_kaizen_scheduled.

Charter pillar: cost (quality per dollar). Roadmap row RM-KAIZEN-SCHEDULED-1, kaizen candidate kc-20260904-router-selfopt. Read 2026-11-05: routing already uses measured health in a binary way: loadModelHealth reads ai_model_health (23 ok, 1 failing, updated 2026-11-05T00:00Z, fed by ai-health-prober and qnfo-ai-calibration) and autoRoute drops a failing or degraded model from its pool, then picks uniformly (seededPick) among the rest. What is missing is the graded step: a healthy model that fails or returns blank answers often is as likely to be picked as a clean one.
Slice: in loadModelHealth, after the ai_model_health read, read the last day of per-model calls and errors for qnfo-ai (ai_call_counters, or the per-model error counts in ai_queries; use the source that counts every routed call) and set status degraded on a model that has at least 50 calls and an error share of 0.3 or more; autoRoute already drops degraded models and falls back to the base pool when the pool empties. Mark the block ROUTER-QUALITY-WEIGHT-1. Keep the cache of 60 s. Test: a fixture with one noisy model in a pool is never picked while two clean ones remain, and a pool of only noisy models still answers.
Prediction: the 24 h error share of auto-routed calls falls by at least a quarter within 7 days of the deploy; guard: spend per call does not rise. Revert: remove the block.

Charter pillar: autonomy. Roadmap row RM-KAIZEN-SCHEDULED-1 (kaizen candidate kc-20260904-kaizen-autoapply, the improvement queue). Measured 2026-11-05: qnfo-audit.fleet_improvements holds 170 rows with source content-signal, kind failure-mode and the same title ([q08] Opaque Computational Mediation of Expertise ...), one filed at :07 of every hour since 2026-09-29 (ids up to 3313), each moved to status queued 43 minutes later (id 3313: created 2026-11-04 19:07:49, updated 19:50:47). contentSignalAudit looks for an existing row with status IN (proposed, approved, in_progress) before filing, so the queued twin is invisible and the next run files again; the signal is a q08 signal that stays open.
Fix: make the existence check read every non-terminal status, at least add queued, so the title is filed once. Test: a fixture with a queued row of the same title files nothing. Leave the 170 rows alone (no deletes); a later sweep may fold them.
Prediction: content-signal rows filed per hour 1 to 0 for an unchanged signal. Revert: restore the old status list.
Closing probe: the old status list is gone from qnfo-fleet-control/worker.js (code-probe above).',
