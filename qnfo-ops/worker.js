The fleet console command line must act like a coding agent, not a question box. The durable agent (POST /agents/ops-exec) gains two ops: start {text, sid, run_id, max_iters up to 24} stores a run and arms the alarm, so a long tool loop runs for minutes without a caller waiting; result {id} returns the run with its live steps (tool, args, ms, output head) and, when finished, the reply. runTurn also returns steps. The fleet dashboard polls result and shows each tool as it runs. prior 2.59.6 */ /* 2.59.5 ISSUE-TOOL-REPO-ARGS-1 (2026-10-26, pillar autonomy, agent_issues 100437 TOOL-FAILURE github_issue_get; patch). github_issue_get failed again at 17:48Z and 19:42Z after the 404 fix of 2.59.2 with the message repo (owner/name) and number required: the model sends {owner, repo, number}, the shape github_repo_read accepts, and the three issue tools (github_issue_get, github_issues_list, github_issue_comment) read repo as one owner/name string and ignored owner. They now resolve the repo with fpaRepoArg: an empty repo is QNFO/qnfo-workers as before, a repo with a slash is used as given, a bare name becomes owner/name when an owner is given and QNFO/name when not (the rule githubRepoRead has had since 2.57.3). A malformed number still answers number required. qnfo-ops/tool-miss-not-failure.test.mjs covers the shapes. prior 2.59.4 */ /* 2.59.4 CANONICAL-REFRESH-1 (2026-10-26, pillar reliability, agent_issues 1000161 CANONICAL-REFRESH-GAP-1; patch). The canonical deploy route had no binding to the qnfo-canonical bucket, so a deploy never refreshed qnfo-canonical/<worker>.js: on 2026-10-25 qnfo-deploy-guard went live at 1.3.29 while the object still held 1.3.25 until a session wrote it by hand, and a stale object is a downgrade hazard for every path that re-asserts it. wrangler.toml now declares the bucket as CANONICAL. After a deploy whose /health version matches the one asked for, /ops/deploy of QNFO/qnfo-workers main writes the deployed source to qnfo-canonical/<worker>.js (customMetadata ts, version, sha256 and actor, the shape qnfo-fleet-control canonical() reads), reads it back, compares byte length and sha-256, answers canonical { ok, parity, bytes, sha256 } and records one canonical_refresh row in cloud_ops_events (status ok, skipped or error).

Both shell tools now stage ops-workspace files into the container before the command: every path in the stage argument (written over the container copy) and every /workspace/<path> the command names that exists in ops-workspace but not on the container disk (filled in, never overwritten); the answer lists the staged files and the root that served each.

An existence lookup that misses is an answer, not a tool malfunction: github_repo_read on a path that does not exist and github_issue_get on an issue number that does not exist now return ok false with the same error text plus a not_found flag, and logToolEvent records a result with that flag as status ok (meta keeps resultOk false and the error text), so a miss no longer files TOOL-FAILURE and self-heal issues or counts toward the 24 h error rate (5 of the last 14 github_repo_read errors were paths that do not exist, and github_issue_get got a GitHub 404 for the D1 issue id 100350). web_search accepts query as an alias of q (the model sent query and was answered q required), and the self-fetch refusal of web_fetch is a rejected result, a correct refusal, not an error. qnfo-ops/tool-miss-not-failure.test.mjs holds 27 checks. prior 2.59.1 OPS-CAPPED-REPLY-1 and OPS-STREAM-ABORT-1 (2026-10-26, pillar reliability, agent_issues 1000446, 1000162; patch). (a) OPS-CAPPED-REPLY-1: callGLM, budgetFallback, callDeepSeekStream and streamFinalAnswer copied reasoning_content into the reply when content was empty and never read finish_reason, so a turn that spent its whole output cap reasoning went out as its own chain of thought and was logged ok = 1 (15 ops_ai_log rows in 14 days at exactly 8000 or 8192 completion tokens); when the turn stopped at the cap (finish_reason length) the reply is now one honest line, which holds none of the truncation phrases of finalize(), so ops_agent_empty_answers_7d is not fed. (b) OPS-STREAM-ABORT-1: one cloud_ops_events row of kind ops_stream_abort per request when a streamed turn ends without its done frame (client cancel, runner throw, heartbeat or done write failure), with the elapsed time, tool calls, last tool, model, whether finalize ran and the newest ops_upstream_error of the previous ten minutes; instrumentation only, the cause of the 234 to 410 second provider_error turns is not yet known. prior 2.59.0-ops-branch-close */ /* 2.59.0 OPS-BRANCH-CLOSE-1, OPS-CF-ANALYTICS-LEDGER-1, OPS-FLEET-RETIRED-1 (2026-10-26, pillar reliability, agent_issues 1000036, 1000043, 1000154; minor: two tools the endpoint did not have).

(2) ops_d1_query "no such column" now reads the live columns (pragma_table_info) of the table the error names, an alias included, or of every table the query reads, instead of the first FROM table in d1_schema_index, so joins and views get their real columns; the index stays the fallback. The loop-breaker signatures of 100079/100083/100127/100128 are already excluded by v_loop_breaker_signatures (live read 2026-10-19 13:05Z: no qnfo-ops row). */ /* 2.50.4 WORKSPACE-CHECKOUT-HINT-1 (2026-10-19, pillar autonomy, agent_issues 100079/100083/100127): a container command that fails because it cd-ed into a /workspace directory that is not there (10 of 11 shell_exec errors in 24 h) answers with a hint that names the fix (clone in the same command, or read with github_repo_read or git_op); the error text is unchanged.

A cd failure now also lists /workspace through the same route (workspace_dirs, workspace_dirs_total) and says that dir must be one of them, that git_clone_exec returns its path, and that the container may have been recycled, the way ops_d1_query returns the real columns for a missing one. */ /* 2.50.2 GITHUB-BRANCH-HINT-1 (2026-10-19, agent_issues 100094, pillar autonomy): github_file_write to a branch that does not exist answered a bare "GitHub 404: Branch X not found"; the chatbox session that hit it (cron-tick-5m, 09:29Z) had skipped github_create_branch and could not tell that from a bad repo or path.

KERNEL-REPLY-1 (metric false_stops_7d 5, doctrine kernel recognitions): the chat prompt gains rule 16: a reply ends with the result, never with a question, an offer or a menu for the user; what is optional is decided. 2.43.1 CF-API-RETRY-1 (2026-10-12, #2396, pillar autonomy): the deploy route's Cloudflare API calls (bindings read, settings read, the script PUT and its re-uploads) retry a transient answer (HTTP 429, 5xx, error code 10013, a network error) up to three times with backoff or Retry-After, the multipart body rebuilt per attempt; a definite refusal (10020, 10021, other 4xx) returns at once. 2.43.0 BINDING-PROPS-RESTORE-1 (2026-10-12, #2445, pillar autonomy): when SECRET-CHANGE-WATCH-1 records a new secret-triggered version of a worker whose wrangler.toml declares props on a [[services]] binding, the tick reads the worker's live settings and, when a declared props object is missing or differs, dispatches canonical-deploy.yml with workers=<name> (one dispatch per worker and secret version, ledger cloud_ops_events kind binding-props-restore), so the props a dashboard secret edit strips come back within one tick without a session (2026-10-12 09:33Z: qnfo-fleet-dashboard lost props.caller on SVC_QNFO_AI and every ask answered HTTP 401 until a redeploy at 11:37Z). 2.42.3 WORKERS-BP-DEBT-1 (#2431, pillar security): the container clone retry suffix takes rndHex8 instead of Math.random; the fleet audit reads 0 fail-class findings for this worker. 2.42.2: a comment count corrected (21 workers at 2026-08-01). 2.42.1: the COMPAT-RESTORE-FAILED-1 issue row carries epoch ms, and the /compat routes log error detail instead of returning it. 2.42.0 COMPAT-DATE-DECLARED-APPLY-1 (2026-10-12, pillar core): the canonical deploy re-sent each worker's live compatibility date and never read wrangler.toml, so no date in the fleet could advance. /ops/deploy now applies a later declared date when the file carries the line "# compat-advance: reviewed YYYY-MM-DD", the date is not after the review or today, and the worker's /health can be read from qnfo-ops; it keeps the date only when /health then answers with the deployed VERSION and otherwise uploads the previous date again (deployment_history action compat-restore, which also stops a retry under the same review). A date never moves back, a refusal by Cloudflare falls back to the live date, and the cf_worker_deploy tool never advances one. COMPAT-EXPOSURE-1: GET /compat lists every live worker's live date, wrangler.toml date, nodejs_compat state and the default changes between (table worker_compat_state, metric workers_compat_date_behind); the cron refreshes it every 6 h, POST /compat/refresh on demand. */ /* 2.41.0 OBSERVABILITY-DECLARED-APPLY-1 (2026-10-12, pillar core): the canonical deploy sent compatibility date, flags, bindings and containers in the upload metadata but never the observability settings, so a worker's [observability], [observability.logs] and [observability.traces] blocks in wrangler.toml never reached Cloudflare (same inert-config class as the crons of #1337 and the flags of COMPAT-FLAGS-DECLARED-APPLY-1). The deploy now overlays the declared keys on the live settings and sends the result; a worker that declares nothing is uploaded as before, and a Cloudflare refusal of the block is retried once without it and reported (observability_apply).

Public requests never carry props. 2.39.2 OPS-CONTEXT-COMPACT-1 (agent_issues 2068, pillar cost): truncateToContext compacts every tool result older than the newest OPS_TOOL_KEEP_ROUNDS (2) tool-bearing rounds to its first OPS_TOOL_COMPACT_CHARS (1200) chars plus a marker that says how much was cut and to re-run the tool for the full output; user, assistant and system messages are never compacted. Every round of an agent loop used to resend all earlier tool output (MAX_TOOL_RESULT_CHARS 16384 each) until the 262k window filled, so cost grew with the square of the round count: BUDGET-AUTO-PROMOTE-1 jobs on 2026-10-03/06 used 2.46M-2.68M prompt tokens for 27-33 tool calls, two ending ok=0. Pure function compactToolRounds, replayed by context-compact.test.mjs. 2.39.1 2.39.1 OPS-COST-SOFT-1 (BUDGET-SOFT-ROUTE-1): the ops daily cost cap (OPS_DAILY_CAP_USD) no longer answers HTTP 429 on chat or /v1/jobs; the request or job runs on the free tier (budgetFallback, no paid exec upstream). The request-count cap and the per-job runaway cap stay. 2.39.0 RULE-8-RETIRED-1 (2026-10-06, pillar autonomy, owner directive: "Rule 8 is now deleted entirely"): system prompt item 15(d) HARD LIMITS becomes DECIDE AND RECORD - spend caps, guard metrics, probes and deletions are the agent's own decisions, recorded with the reason and a live measurement under rule 7; opt-out, outreach consent and cadence caps and the personal/research separation still hold. 2.38.47 (2026-10-06, pillar core): REGISTRY-SYNC-FOLDED-1 (agent_issues 2031): a FLEET entry for a folded member (qnfo-backlog-exec, a member of qnfo-lifecycle since BACKLOG-FOLD-1) carries kind member and its host route, so registryRefresh writes service_registry with the URL that serves it and kind member instead of the deleted worker's dead workers.dev URL as a live worker (07:30:59Z wrote https://qnfo-backlog-exec.q08.workers.dev and fleet_status reported it "Worker not found"); OPS-D1-LIMIT-WORD-1 (agent_issues 2033): ops_d1_query finds an existing LIMIT clause as a trailing word, not as the first "limit" substring, so a query that names a column such as limited and ends in LIMIT 10 is no longer given a second LIMIT 100 (D1_ERROR near "LIMIT": syntax error, 07:53:42Z). */

// budget walk. A round is one non-tool message plus the tool messages that follow it (the grouping truncateToContext already
// uses). Tool-bearing rounds age from the newest: the newest OPS_TOOL_KEEP_ROUNDS stay whole; the next OPS_TOOL_MID_ROUNDS get the
// MID level; every older one gets the OLD level. At a level (1) a tool message longer than its limit keeps its head and its tail
// with a note between them, and (2) the assistant message that made the calls keeps a tail of its reasoning_content, a head and
// tail of a long content, and its tool_call arguments with every long string value shortened (same keys, still valid JSON), so
// every round keeps its call and a trace of its result and the model can see what it already ran. Measured 2026-10-19 (ops_ai_log
// source job, 7 days): with 2.39.2 alone a 40-turn job still sent 1,593,580 prompt tokens, because the assistant messages (about
// 870 completion tokens a turn) and the 1,200-char excerpts of every older round rode along on every later round. System messages,

  "Scope: operations on the QNFO cloud-native fleet - workers, D1, R2, Vectorize, crons, email accounts, agent backlog, audits, and running code. Research questions belong on the research endpoint; ops commands belong here.",
  "AUTONOMY CONTRACT (core, binding):",
  "A1. EXECUTE, DO NOT NARRATE: when the user asks for an ops action (check email, list open issues, fleet status, run an audit, execute a snippet, audit the fleet), call the matching tool(s) and report REAL results with evidence. Never fabricate tool output, counts, versions, or statuses.",
  "A2. LOOP UNTIL DONE: a task is finished only when the tool calls have run and you report their actual output. Chain as many tool calls as needed in one turn (read -> verify -> compute -> report) without stopping to ask permission. Never stop after one tool call to ask whether to continue.",
  "A3. NEVER HAND-HOLD: never ask the user to run commands locally, open a browser, or report back anything you can do with a tool. Every in-scope action maps to a server-side tool: SQL -> ops_d1_query, compute -> run_code, files -> workspace_*/r2_*, fleet -> fleet_status, mailbox -> email_*, web -> web_fetch/web_search, GitHub -> github_*. If a tool can do it, DO IT; never describe doing it.",
  "A4. run_code IS YOUR COMPUTE ENGINE: use it autonomously for any pure computation, verification, data transform, or math (finite JS that returns a value or console.logs text). Never ask the user to run code locally - you run it server-side.",
  "A5. READ-ONLY AND COMPUTE ACTIONS EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY (no confirmation). Only DESTRUCTIVE/irreversible actions gate on explicit confirmation (rules 3/3b below).",
  "A6. ONE-SHOT COMPLETION (binding, 2026-09-12): the user gives ONE natural-language instruction and expects the WHOLE task planned, executed, verified and reported in that single turn, server-side, with NO further prompting. Never end a turn with a progress report, a checkpoint, or a promise of future work ('then I will', 'next I will', 'I will run', 'remains to', 'the next batch', 'saving the report', 'before touching the PR'). If work remains, CALL THE NEXT TOOL NOW in this same turn and keep going. A turn that ends by announcing what you would do next is a FAILED turn. End only with the completed deliverable, or - if genuinely blocked by a missing tool/credential/permission - exactly one final line 'INCOMPLETE: <what remains and why>'.",

  "3. Only DESTRUCTIVE/irreversible actions require confirm:true - ops_issue_run (triggers the backlog-executor drain), email_respond (sends a reply), email_mark (changes message status). With confirm false/omitted on those, return the plan without executing. Every other tool (read-only, compute, web, GitHub read, workspace) runs immediately.",

Pure-compute code runs via run_code (Dynamic Workers LOADER, no network/filesystem/secrets). Never fabricate run_code output.",

ADVERSARIAL-REASONING-1 (anti-sycophancy / anti-confirmation-bias): never flatter, defer, or agree with the user or a source merely because it was stated - when evidence contradicts the premise, say so plainly with counter-evidence; actively seek disconfirming evidence and state the strongest argument against your own answer; expose at least one concrete failure mode (limitation, missing evidence, edge case, or falsifying observation) in every substantive response; label uncertainty, never inflate confidence.",
  "11. SERVER-SIDE-EXECUTION GUARANTEE (binding): the client you serve may be a mobile/Android LLM client (e.g. ChatBox Android) with NO native ability to run code, open files, execute shell commands, or invoke tools on-device - ALL code and tool calls MUST execute server-side on Cloudflare, never on the client device. You are the SOLE executor of every code/tool operation. NEVER emit code, shell commands, SQL, or tool-call syntax FOR the client to run locally, and NEVER ask the user to run/paste/open/install anything on their device (the client cannot do it). For every request involving compute, data, files, web, mail, fleet, or repos, execute it YOURSELF server-side via run_code / ops_d1_query / workspace_* / r2_* / web_fetch / web_search / email_* / fleet_status / github_* and return the COMPLETED result with evidence.",
  "12. OPS-SETTINGS-IMMUTABLE-1 (binding systemwide, 2026-09-09): this endpoint uses canonical settings that are IMMUTABLE across every client (DeepChat, ChatBox, SannaBot): context window 1048576, max output 393216, tool-loop soft budget 300s, Workflow step timeout 15 minutes, CPU ceiling 300s. They MUST NEVER be lowered by any agent, session, process, or env override. The ops-settings-guard.py drift gate enforces them every 30 min; long or CPU-heavy work goes through the durable async path (x-ops-async:1 / POST /v1/jobs), never by reducing these ceilings. Report drift; do not change settings.",
  "13. WBS-PLANNING + DEFINITION-OF-DONE (binding, all threads, 2026-09-18): before executing any task needing 2+ tool calls, state a short WBS plan (P0..Pn steps, one goal each) and mark each step done with its tool evidence as you go. At the end of every substantive task, run a DoD audit and state the verdict PASS / PASS-WITH-NOTES / FAIL: (a) VERIFIED - every done claim is backed by a same-turn tool result, never memory or inference; (b) ZERO-DEFERRED - nothing left open without an explicit owner; (c) GUARDS-GREEN - relevant guards/checks exited 0; (d) CLAIM-SHEET - locked claims carry claim/evidence/confidence/status; (e) FAILURE-MODES - at least one concrete way the result could be wrong. A substantive turn that omits the WBS plan or the DoD audit is an incomplete turn.",
  "14. PUBLICATION-PREFLIGHT-GATE-1 (#1118): before promising, scheduling or reporting as pending any publication on a public surface (q08.org pieces, feeds), read the latest result with ops_d1_query db=audit: SELECT ts, status, text FROM cloud_ops_events WHERE kind = 'publication_preflight' ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 1 (qnfo-fleet-control runs it hourly: health served by the surface worker, JSON listing not the fallback homepage, real RSS/Atom feed). Promise the publication only if status=ok and ts is under 2h old. Otherwise do not report it as pending work: state the failing check from the row and raise or point to the open PUBLICATION-PREFLIGHT-FAIL agent_issue.",
  "15. FLEET-CORE-1 (binding, owner directive 2026-10-02): (a) OWN THE FIX - filing an issue is not fixing it. For a defect, name the owning loop and do the work with tools; hand a single-file code change to the code loop by ending the agent_issues description with a line of its own `code-task: repo=qnfo-workers path=<dir>/worker.js`. Close an issue only with a live measurement in issue_triage.close_evidence, never as wontfix to shrink the backlog. (b) MEASURE - the scoreboard is metric_registry judged by v_metric_trigger_state (hit = 1 is a breach; metrics_in_breach target 0). Guard metrics (kind = 'guard') must not worsen: a target gained while a guard worsens is a regression. (c) LEARN-APPLY-VERIFY - one change at a time with a stated prediction; measure after; keep it only if the metric moved, otherwise revert and try a different lever. (d) DECIDE AND RECORD (RULE-8-RETIRED-1, owner directive 2026-10-06: core prompt rule 8 is deleted) - spend caps, guard metrics, verification probes and data deletion are the fleet's own decisions: take them when the evidence supports them and record the reason and the live measurement on the issue; back up and read back before a deletion because it costs nothing; follow rule 7 for any self-change (a probe you did not write, a revert path). Still never: mail an address that opted out, send outreach outside its consent gate and cadence caps, or move personal-plane data into the research plane or onto a public surface. (e) CLOSEOUT - when asked to close out, report objective, actions with evidence, deviations, failures and fixes, artifacts written, metric deltas, and every open item with its exact blocker.",
  "16. KERNEL-REPLY-1 (binding, docs/DOCTRINE-KERNEL.md recognitions, 2026-10-12): a reply ends with the result. Never end with a question to the user, a conditional offer ('would you like', 'if you want', 'shall I', 'let me know if', 'want me to'), or a menu of options for the user to pick from. When a next step is optional, decide it: take it when it is reversible and in scope and report it done, or state in one line that it is not taken and why. When the request is ambiguous, state the assumption in one line and answer under it. A question is allowed only when the action is irreversible and only the owner can decide it, and then it is one line that names the irreversible act."

/* COMPAT-DATE-DECLARED-APPLY-1 (2.42.0, 2026-10-12, pillar core). cfWorkerDeploy re-sent each worker's LIVE compatibility
   date on every upload and never read the date in wrangler.toml, so no date in the fleet could advance (measured 2026-10-12:
   21 of 28 live workers at 2026-08-01). The date in a wrangler.toml is applied only when all of this holds: the file carries
   the line `# compat-advance: reviewed YYYY-MM-DD`, its date is later than the live date, not later than the review date and
   not in the future, the caller asked for it (only /ops/deploy does, after it has seen the worker's /health answer), and no
   earlier advance to the same date under the same review was restored. A date never moves back through this path.

   page (developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags, read 2026-10-12): `needs` names what a worker
   must use for the change to reach it. Python-only and container-only defaults are left out. */
