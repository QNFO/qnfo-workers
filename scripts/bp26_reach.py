"""BP26-REACH-1 collectors (2026-10-26, charter pillar reach; agent_issues 1000347 BP26-EMAIL-AUTH-1, 1000340 BP26-SOCIAL-AUTOMATION-1; owner directive 2026-10-26).

The runner half of five BP26 metrics, run by scripts/bp26_producers.py from the remediation-consumer job. Every value is measured from the real thing; a collector that cannot
measure returns None and writes nothing. No address, post text or message is stored or printed: only counts and per-domain, per-source or per-platform verdicts.

  collect_dmarc          dmarc_aligned_pass_rate
        The DMARC aggregate reports that arrive daily at the fleet's rua mailbox (google.com, lolipop.jp, ...) are stored as raw MIME in qnfo-audit.email_raw_archive. This parses the
        zip or gzip XML attachment of every report whose date range ended in the last 7 days; a message passes DMARC when its dkim OR spf result in policy_evaluated is pass (those
        fields are the ALIGNED results). value = passing messages / all messages across every reporting domain, weighted by the report's count. Rows: one per (domain, reporter) with counts.
        The same run reads the sending domains' SPF, the Cloudflare DKIM selector and the DMARC policy through DNS-over-HTTPS and keeps them in bp26_dns_email_auth (a collector
        reads DNS, it never writes it). Limits: a domain without a rua tag (q08.org on 2026-10-26) sends no reports, so its mail is unmeasured and the note names it.
  collect_rfc8058        rfc8058_headers_present
        A code-state check, because the mail log does not carry headers: for each path that sends LIST mail (a digest or newsletter to a standing subscriber list) the worker source
        must set both List-Unsubscribe and List-Unsubscribe-Post (List-Unsubscribe=One-Click), print an unsubscribe link in the body, and serve a /unsubscribe route. value = paths that
        satisfy all four / list-mail paths. One-to-one mail (outreach, errata, owner notices) is not list mail and is not counted.
  collect_unsubscribe    unsubscribe_honoured_48h
        Opt-outs of the last 30 days: qnfo-audit.subscribers rows that are unsubscribed, and email_suppression rows with reason unsubscribe or reply-stop. An opt-out is honoured when it
        was processed within 48 h of the request (the request time is the newest inbound mail from that address before the suppression, or the click itself for a link handler, which is
        synchronous) AND nothing was sent to the address more than 48 h after (outreach_log, subscribers.last_digest_at). The queries run inside D1; no address leaves it.
  collect_social_labels  social_bot_label_enabled
        Automated social accounts whose platform bot or automated label is verifiably on / all automated accounts. Bluesky: the public AppView profile (labels); Mastodon: the public
        accounts/lookup `bot` field. X and LinkedIn cannot be read without credentials: they count as NOT verified-enabled and are listed as unverifiable until the owner card
        bp26-social-bot-labels closes.
  collect_social_mentions social_unsolicited_mentions
        Automated posts of the last 7 days that carry an @mention of an account that is not the fleet's own, from the post text that exists: social_threads.posts (Bluesky threads, full
        text), social_media_posts.content_preview and dissemination_tracker.post_text_snippet (the first 200 characters or so of Buffer posts). The fleet has no code path that replies to
        a third party (the only reply object in qnfo-social/worker.js continues its own thread); the scan counts those sites as a tripwire. Every mention found is counted as unsolicited,
        because the tables hold no link from a mention to a user interaction. The note states how many posts had text.
