-- CODE-TASKS-CTX-COMPACT-1 (2026-11-04, charter pillar cost; D1 overload family D1-OVERLOAD-1; owner: "table rows are bloated and need to be regularly swept", RETENTION-SWEEP-1).
-- Measured 2026-11-04 ~17:35Z on qnfo-audit. Three statements that read code_tasks.ctx were among the top consumers of D1 TIME in 17:00-17:12Z while reading almost no rows:
--   qnfo-fleet-control cmCloseSuperseded:  SELECT ... FROM code_tasks WHERE ctx LIKE '%superseded_pr%' ...            14 calls, 39 s of D1 time (2.8 s each, 1.4 K rows)
--   qnfo-code-orchestrator claimsSweep:    SELECT ... WHERE status IN (...) AND json_extract(ctx, '$.claim.token') ...   27 + 39 calls, 33 s + 10 s
--   about 82 s of D1 time in 12 minutes, about 11 % of the single-threaded database, for the cost of parsing text, not of rows.
-- Cause: code_tasks.ctx holds the working blobs of the code loop and nothing removes them when a task is finished. 1,428 tasks hold 325 MB of ctx: merged 133.9 MB (425), superseded 93.7 MB (550),
-- failed 73.3 MB (314), closed 19.2 MB (105). On a sample of 40 finished tasks, ctx.base (the repository file as read when the task started, average 281 KB, up to 801 KB) is 85 % of the bytes,
-- ctx.patch 11 %, ctx.win_text 2.5 %, ctx.x 1.5 %; the keys the readers use (claim, anchor, superseded_pr, sigs, lastError, edits, suite_rebase_reason) total under 3 KB.
-- Change: an incremental retention trigger on fleet_tick_heavy (every ~10 minutes) removes the four blob keys with json_remove from at most 40 finished tasks per tick: status merged, closed or
-- superseded and not updated for 2 days, or failed and not updated for 7 days (an ISO updated_at; a few rows hold an epoch number and are left alone), ctx larger than 20,000 characters. Every other key is kept, so claim sweeps, anchors and superseded_pr
-- still work; nothing else on the row changes (updated_at and status are not touched, no other trigger fires: the only UPDATE OF ctx trigger is the JSON-validity guard). The ledger
-- code_task_ctx_compacted records task, status, bytes before and after, keys removed and batch. The removed content is derived and recoverable: base is the repository file at the task's start
-- (git history of path, branch and merged_sha), patch is the pull request diff (pr_url).
-- Prediction: about 246 MB of the 325 MB (merged, superseded and closed older than 2 days, failed older than 7: about 1,000 tasks, at 40 a tick, about 6 hours) -> under 5 MB; total code_tasks ctx 325 MB -> about 80 MB
-- (younger finished tasks and active ones stay until they age); the three statements above fall from about 82 s per 12 minutes of D1 time to about 20 s. Verify: SELECT SUM(length(ctx)) FROM code_tasks, the ledger, and the same GraphQL by D1 time.
-- Off switch: ops_config code_tasks_ctx_compact = off.
-- APPLY-BY: ci
-- DB: qnfo-audit
-- Rollback: DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS code_tasks_ctx_compact_tick; the removed blobs are not restored (they are recoverable from git, see above); DROP TABLE IF EXISTS code_task_ctx_compacted when its rows are no longer wanted
-- spof-review: one retention trigger on fleet_tick_heavy (a failure there is logged by the orchestrator and never stops fleet_tick), one small ledger table.
-- CAUSE-MAPPED: registers no metric_registry row.
