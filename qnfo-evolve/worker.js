/* qnfo-evolve — EVOLVE-1
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   On 2026-10-17 the fleet's own registers said, in its own words, what was wrong and nobody was
 *   doing anything about it. v_process_path_gaps listed three steps whose only path read
 *   "none automatic" (research-head-stalled, code-task-stalled, issue-unremediated); v_dod_spof_gaps
 *   listed qnfo-research-exec as NO-ALTERNATE-PATH and GitHub Actions plus the GitHub token as
 *   ALTERNATE-NEVER-TESTED. The owner doctrine (SLA-AND-PATHS-1, 2026-10-17) says every step needs
 *   an SLA and at least two independent paths, and it is VIOLATED BY THE FLEET'S OWN TABLES with no
 *   consequence, because nothing in the fleet reads those tables and turns them into work.
 *
 *   Measured the same day: 169 issues open, 25 carrying a code-task line; issue_plans held 6 queued
 *   against 128 "not-code", and 67 of those refusals were the same sentence -- "the issue names no
 *   worker the code loop may change". So the loop was not idle because the fleet had nothing to fix.
 *   It was idle because the fleet never said WHICH WORKER should fix it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   Every quarter hour it reads the fleet's structural gap registers, keeps only the gaps whose
 *   owning worker it can name, and files ONE issue per gap in the shape the code loop accepts:
 *   the live worker named, the file named, the reproduction SQL, and a machine-evaluable definition
 *   of done. It then re-runs each probe and closes the issue itself when the gap disappears.
 *   That closes the missing arc: registered gap -> named work -> merged change -> verified closure.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *   * It never edits code, never opens a pull request, never deploys, never changes a view. It writes
 *     only agent_issues rows (its own source) and its own three tables. A bug here can file a bad
 *     issue; it cannot damage a worker.
 *   * It never re-words a gap into something easier. If the owning worker cannot be named it records
 *     the skip and moves on, rather than filing the unplannable prose that starved the loop.
 *   * It files at most MAX_NEW_PER_TICK per tick and holds at most MAX_OPEN open filings, so a wide
 *     register cannot flood a loop that plans a handful of tasks a day.
 *
 * READING
 *   GET /health  version, last run, open filings (public read)
 *   GET /report  the last 20 filings and the last run (public read)
 *   POST /tick   same work as the cron; needs x-loop-token when LOOP_TOKEN is configured

 * queue could only drain by a task SUCCEEDING -- which the builder was failing to do at roughly 3:2.
 * That is a closed loop with one exit, and the owner doctrine (SLA-AND-PATHS-1: every step needs two
 * independent paths to a successful definition of done) says a step with one exit is a defect.
 *
 * So this is the second path: a task that has burned WIP_ATTEMPTS attempts and has not moved for
 * WIP_STALE_MIN minutes is parked as 'failed' with its full row backed up to ops_config, which frees
 * a planning slot. It is deliberately timid -- it never touches a task with fewer than 6 attempts, it
 * never touches one that moved in the last 10 minutes (it may be mid-attempt), it acts at most twice a
 * tick, and it only acts while the queue is actually blocked. Restore is one statement:
