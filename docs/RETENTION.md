# Data minimisation and retention policy — DRAFT for owner review

Status: **DRAFT, 2026-10-26** (BP26-RETENTION-1, agent_issues 1000344). Written by an automated fleet session. **Every period below is a proposal** (`retention_policy.policy_status = 'proposed'`); none is a statement of what the law requires of the owner. The only figure taken from outside is the catalogue's: the e-mail agent keeps message bodies at most 30 days (BP26 item 4.3). **Nothing is deleted by this policy today**: the fleet counts what is past each period and waits for the owner's decision (card `bp26-retention-enforce`, IDENTITY-BOUND, because deleting mail-derived personal data is irreversible). Related: docs/ROPA.md (the activities), docs/dpia/ (the risks).

## 1. How it works

- The registry is the table `retention_policy` in qnfo-audit (migrations/2026-10-26-bp26-privacy.sql): one row per policy with its database, table, the columns a sweep would blank, the period, whether it is personal data, the basis, and the read-only `SELECT COUNT(*)` that counts rows past the period that still hold the data.
- The 13 policies on qnfo-audit tables are counted hourly by the trigger `bp26_retention_heavy_tick` on `fleet_tick_heavy`. The 6 policies on other databases (ipatent-db, q08-signal, living-paper) are counted by `scripts/bp26_privacy.py collect_retention_other_dbs` in the remediation-consumer job, which writes the count into the row. The metric `records_past_retention` is the sum (target 0).
- `enforcement` is `report` for every row. A sweep is built only after the owner answers the card; it reads `retention_policy` where `enforcement = 'enforce'` and `ops_config.retention_enforce = 'on'`, backs up what it blanks, and logs each run.
- The personal plane (personal-life: the twin, the companion list) is not read by the research runner and is not counted here; its own periods are in the twin DPIA (open question 4).

## 2. The policies (proposed)

| Policy key | Database and table | What the sweep would blank or delete | Period | Why (proposal) | Past period on 2026-10-26 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `emails_bodies_30d` | qnfo-audit `emails` | body_text, body_html, headers_json | 30 days | Storage limitation; BP26 item 4.3 | **683** |
| `email_raw_archive_30d` | qnfo-audit `email_raw_archive` | raw_text | 30 days | The raw message holds everything the parsed body does plus attachments | **5** |
| `email_loop_quarantine_30d` | qnfo-audit `email_loop_quarantine` | body_text | 30 days | A copy kept only to explain why a message was not processed | **105** |
| `email_reply_queue_drafts_90d` | qnfo-audit `email_reply_queue` | draft_text, draft_proposed | 90 days | A draft quotes the sender; the decision row stays | 0 |
| `email_commands_180d` | qnfo-audit `email_commands` | command_text, result | 180 days | The owner's commands, kept to audit what the fleet did | 0 |
| `email_parse_failures_90d` | qnfo-audit `email_parse_failures` | content_hint | 90 days | The issue it raised carries the fix | 0 |
| `subscribers_pending_30d` | qnfo-audit `subscribers` | the row (an unconfirmed opt-in) | 30 days | No consent was ever given | 0 |
| `subscribers_unsubscribed_30d` | qnfo-audit `subscribers` | the row; `email_suppression` stays | 30 days | The suppression record is the minimal proof of an opt-out | 0 |
| `contact_ledger_1095d` | qnfo-audit `contact_ledger` | the row, unless suppressed | 1,095 days after last contact | Three years without contact; suppressed rows stay so nobody is approached twice | 0 |
| `mcp_log_90d` | qnfo-audit `mcp_log` | args, result | 90 days | Tool arguments and results can hold addresses and message text | 0 |
| `email_calendar_delivery_90d` | qnfo-audit `email_calendar_delivery` | finished rows | 90 days | A finished reminder or acknowledgement | 0 |
| `handoffs_email_180d` | qnfo-audit `handoffs` | summary, pending_work, next_action of strategic-mail handoffs | 180 days | A handoff summarises a sender and a snippet | 0 |
| `emails_metadata_365d` | qnfo-audit `emails` | the row (who, when, subject) | 365 days | Reply and audit trail for a year | 0 |
| `ipatent_sessions_90d` | ipatent-db `sessions` | the row (raw IP address, user agent) | 90 days | Counters keep what is needed | **11** (runner) |
| `ipatent_analytics_90d` | ipatent-db `analytics` | the row | 90 days | Per-event analytics with a raw IP address | **41** (runner) |
| `ipatent_submission_ip_90d` | ipatent-db `submissions` | ip_address, user_agent | 90 days | Not needed once the draft is delivered | **41** (runner) |
| `ipatent_submissions_730d` | ipatent-db `submissions` | the row | 730 days | Two years after writing unless the submitter asks to keep it | 0 (runner) |
| `q08_subscribers_pending_30d` | q08-signal `subscribers` | the row | 30 days | Unconfirmed opt-in | 0 (runner) |
| `living_paper_email_logs_30d` | living-paper `email_logs` | the row | 30 days | A mail log with sender, subject and body; empty today | 0 (runner) |

Total: 793 on qnfo-audit at apply, 886 after the runner's first count of the ipatent-db rows (11 + 41 + 41). The counts were read on 2026-10-26 before the migration was written; the live value is `SELECT last_value FROM metric_registry WHERE metric = 'records_past_retention'`.

## 3. Not in the registry, and why

- **R2 objects and lifecycle rules.** The BP26 item also names R2 lifecycle rules. Which buckets hold personal data (ipatent `r2_key` documents, mail attachments if any) has not been read; this is a code task for the owners of qnfo-ipatent and qnfo-email.
- **Workers Logs, AI Gateway logs and GitHub Actions logs.** Retention of Workers Logs and AI Gateway logs is set by the Cloudflare plan and the gateway settings, not by a table; whether payload logging is off for mail and twin calls is not verified (BP26 item 4.3 asks for `cf-aig-collect-log-payload: false`). The measured exposure is `pii_in_logs`: crawler `From` headers in Workers Logs, 57 to 68 address matches in each 2,000-event sample on 2026-10-26.
- **Social replies metadata** (`social_replies`: a hash of the author and a text length) and **cloud_ops_events**: no personal content; a period of 365 days is proposed for the first and is not registered yet.
- **Published artifacts** (papers, essays, forecasts) are permanent by design; corrections and retractions follow BP26-CORRECTIONS-FEED-1.

## 4. What happens next

1. The owner answers the card: `enforce`, `adjust <policy_key> <days>` (the registry row is changed by a migration), or `keep`.
2. On `enforce`, the code loop builds the sweep as a change to qnfo-email (mail tables), qnfo-subscribers (subscriber rows) and qnfo-ipatent (ipatent-db), each behind `ops_config.retention_enforce`, with a backup table named before any delete (MIGRATION-RUNNER-1) and a `decision_log` row per run.
3. `records_past_retention` falls to 0 as periods are met; until then it is an honest breach.
