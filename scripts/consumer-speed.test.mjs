// CONSUMER-SPEED-1 suite (2026-11-04, pillar autonomy): pins the shape of .github/workflows/remediation-consumer.yml that made its runs finish inside the cap, and the
// gate and measurement behind it. Offline. Run: node scripts/consumer-speed.test.mjs
//
// Before: one `consume` job of 26-32 minutes (half of the runs cancelled at its 30-minute cap) ran the contract run, then the sweeps, the cost ledger, the continuity
// snapshot with its weekly export and the restore drill, in series. A contract that became due mid-run waited for the next run; a two-pass close took 80 minutes.
// After: `consume` (contract run + status), `sweeps` (every cycle, beside it) and `heavy` (cost ledger, weekly export, restore drill) behind the gate's 3-hour stamp.
