// CANONICAL-FAILOPEN-1 + CRON-MANDATE-1 (qnfo-fleet-control 0.45.4), offline.
// Two defects found on 2026-10-25 while verifying a deploy:
//   1. canonical() returned the last-resort R2 copy with no freshness flag, so redeploy() could deploy a build older
//      than live whenever every GitHub source failed at once (the object then held 2.54.4 while live was 2.55.3).
//   2. the cron was */5 + hourly = 312 fires/day, over CRON-MANDATE-1's 144 cap. The earlier debloat 0708e81d was
//      reverted because it also deleted the hourly trigger - the ONLY path into scheduledOnce's hourly fan-out.
// ADVERSARIAL: source-shape plus one executed pure function. It cannot prove the deployed worker behaves this way; the
// live proof is the cron read-back (GET /schedules) and a heartbeat with the new VERSION on the next */10 tick.
