--  * 1000778 asks for the missing outcome measure for papers: papers_per_100usd_7d did not exist, so its probe could never pass. This registers it (scripts/cost_ledger.py write_paper_yield, same
--    7-day window and published count as research_neurons_per_publication_7d), with a floor trigger and its cause mapping.
--  * 1000780 yield side is met (issue closures per $100 7d: 324.69 against the 251.8 baseline, remedy quality 0.53 against 0.53) but the contract sat 'superseded:probe-unusable' although its probe is
--    machine-executable; it is re-armed so the one open condition (monthly spend 1151.13 against a 300 budget, within_monthly_budget 0) is measured, not hidden.
--  * 1000817 (cause:unmapped): three breaching metrics still have no metric_breach_cause row after LEDGER-TRUTH-E-1 (PR 7347) mapped nine: mapped here.
--  * 1000824 (program QNFO.OPS): its probe counted 'unmeasured' metrics (exempt, tracked by METRIC-UNMEASURED-1) and triggers whose queue_target is a loop or the owner alert channel (human_wait_*,
--    the PLUS-PHILOSOPHY-1 rates, queue_target qnfo-fleet-control / alerts), none of which is a missing issue-doer. It now counts breaching metrics whose trigger files agent_issues and that have neither a
--    code-task lever nor an open issue.
--  * 1001338 1001343 1001348 (INTENT-TASK cards for research topics): their probes measured three global properties of every type='task' intent (19 legacy untriaged rows, 6 research-feed intents
--    with no research_queue row, 218 intents with no task_dod_register row), not the item. The three topics are already in the research intake as owner-authored idea_proposals 2564 (substrate
--    geometry and chess boards), 2567 (convolution and Fourier operators) and 2568 (interstellar messaging), held by the 50 percent diversity cap by design (idea-hub diversity-cap.test.mjs: an
--    owner idea cannot bypass the cap) and released best score first. The probes now read that state per item.
--  * 1000781 1000802 1000812 1000814 1000819 duplicate an open metric-trigger issue that carries the same measure, lever and doer (100222, 100464, 1000979, 1798, 99939). They are superseded by
--    those issues with the measured values in the evidence; the survivors stay open and are the closing probes.
