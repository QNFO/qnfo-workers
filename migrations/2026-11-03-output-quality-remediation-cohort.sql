-- OUTPUT-QUALITY-REMEDIATION-COHORT-1, charter pillar reach; fixes QNFO/qnfo-workers#5412 (agent_issues 1000621).
-- The pool fell 80.8 -> 68.6 while matched subjects improved 41.1 -> 44.2 (issue lever review, 2026-11-02).
-- Compare latest verdicts for the SAME subjects in two adjacent seven-day windows ending on the latest snapshot day.
-- Keep the all-subject remediation_latest_pass_pct_7d guard, its history, thresholds and failed verifications unchanged.
