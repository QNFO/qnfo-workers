/* qnfo-github-steward — GITHUB-STEWARD-1
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   GitHub settings for the QNFO estate were optimised once, by hand, and then drifted: 0 of 61
 *   active repositories deleted a merged branch, 3 of 61 protected their default branch, one
 *   organisation-level default handed every member ADMIN on every repository, and the org-wide
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN still defaulted to write. A setting is only an optimisation if something keeps
 *   putting it back. This worker is that something.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   Every six hours it reads the estate (one org + the owner's personal account), compares each
 *   repository and the organisation to a declared DESIRED state, writes what actually differs,
 *   and records the run in D1. It never edits workflow YAML: a heuristic rewrite of a build file
 *   is how a green pipeline becomes a red one, so workflow findings are REPORTED, and the ones
 *   that need a human or the fleet's code-agent are named explicitly.
 *
 * SAFETY
 *   * additive only -- it sets merge/branch/protection policy, never deletes a repository,
 *     never archives, never touches workflow files, never pushes commits;
 *   * a field the platform refuses (free plan: branch protection and auto-merge on private
 *     repositories) is recorded as a permanent limitation, not retried as a failure;
 *   * archived repositories are read-only and are skipped, not reported as drift;
 *   * GET /report and GET /health are public reads; POST /tick needs STEWARD_KEY.

// 0.10.4 CAPABILITY-CONTRACT-REFRESH-1 (#2852, pillar autonomy; patch: re-publish the declared /health lists for a fresh live capability audit).
var VERSION = "0.10.4-narrative-guard-wording"; // 0.10.3 NARRATIVE-GUARD-WORDING-1 (2026-11-01, pillar autonomy; patch): a comment in psPlace (0.10.1) used a phrase that scripts/narrative-prompt-guard.py bans in every worker source, comments included, so the NARRATIVE-PROMPT-GUARD-1 step of deploy-gate went red on main from #5526 onward; the comment and its tag are reworded (the tag is now PIN-PROGRAM-ROW-1). No behaviour change. 0.10.2 FM-ACTOR-1-INDIVIDUAL-1 (2026-11-01, pillar autonomy; patch): every FM-ACTOR-1 issue is mirrored individually at every priority, excluded from digests, and reopened if GitHub closes it while D1 remains open. 0.10.1 PLACE-ALL-OPEN-1 + PS-SCOPE-SUBQUERY-1 (2026-10-30, pillar autonomy; patch): (a) psPlace places every open agent_issue on a project, mirrored or not (it joined gh_issue_links, so the 149 high and medium issues that ISSUE-ROLLUP-1 stopped mirroring had no issue_project_map row and every program roll-up ignored them); an issue that names an active worker in its title goes to that worker's project before the fleet-control fallback; (b) the roadmap mirror step and GET /roadmap no longer bind roadmap_mirror_scope as a NOT IN list (138 sources against D1's 100 bound variables: "D1_ERROR: too many SQL variables" on every tick since 0.8.0, GET /roadmap answered 500, 82 roadmap rows stayed unmirrored and portfolio_drift read 83); with the table present the filter is a subquery on it. // 0.10.0 ISSUE-ROLLUP-1 (owner directive 2026-10-26 "reduce open issues to <100", pillar autonomy; minor: a decision the worker now takes on its own): an agent_issues row whose priority is not in ops_config gh_individual_priorities (default critical) is no longer its own GitHub issue; its mirror is closed not_planned and D1 stays authoritative and open; one [digest] issue per program lists the rolled rows (gh_digest_links), and one lists the goals while roadmap_mirror_scope has goals at mirrored = 0. Deleting the ops_config key restores one issue per row. // 0.9.1 PS-KEEP-CATALOGUE-PROJECT-1 (2026-10-26, agent_issues 2993, pillar autonomy; patch): psPlace keeps an open issue on an active project that is not a W.<worker> project (a catalogue project such as BP26.EDITORIAL) instead of placing it by owner onto W.<owner>; the 30 BP26 catalogue issues had all been moved to W.qnfo-ops, which left five BP26 projects with no mapped issue and the no-mapped-work detector reporting them. 0.9.0 ROADMAP-TWIN-ROWS-1 (2026-10-26, pillar autonomy; minor: a decision the worker now takes on its own): a roadmap row whose artifact_type is agent_issue is the twin of a TRACKER-SYNC-1 ticket and is never a GitHub issue, whatever source writes it; the source best-practice-2026 had doubled 31 tickets in an hour. 0.8.0 PORTFOLIO-NOT-ISSUES-1 (owner question 2026-10-26 "why are there over 800 GitHub issues?", pillar autonomy; minor: the worker now decides which roadmap sources are Issues): 181 of the 381 open roadmap issues could never close or were a second ticket (77 projects, 75 metric-breach twins of METRIC-TRIGGER issues, 29 failure_modes registry rows). Sources with mirrored = 0 in roadmap_mirror_scope (default projects, metric-breach, failure_modes while the table is absent) are no longer filed, are never placed, and an open GitHub issue for one is closed not_planned with a comment that says it is not a verification and is never reopened; the public /roadmap count skips them. // 0.7.6 FLEET-PR-SHARE-1 (agent_issues 100420): hourly fleet_authored_pr_share_7d from two GitHub search counts; CLOSE-PROVENANCE-1 also finds RED-DRAIN-1 goals. // 0.7.5 CLOSE-PROVENANCE-1: a completed close comment names the merged fleet PR, or states that no code changed. // 0.7.4 HEALTH-CONTRACT-1 (agent_issues 2852, capability_contract_conformance, pillar autonomy; patch, no behaviour change): /health declares capabilities[] and limitations[] (module constants CAPABILITIES and LIMITATIONS), so the fleet snapshot counts this worker as conforming (it was one of the two empty rows holding the metric at 0.9412). // 0.7.3 MODEL-FLOOR-GUARD-RUNS-OBJECT-1 (agent_issues 100258, pillar autonomy; patch: a read that always came back empty): the workflow-runs endpoint answers an object {workflow_runs: [...]}, and paginate() keeps only array bodies, so recordModelFloorGuardRun never created model_floor_guard_runs (the table does not exist in qnfo-audit) and modelFloorGuardVisibility (0.7.2) wrote status "empty", runs 0 on every run although the workflow has 400+ runs on main. DESIRED_REPO is the settings object, not a repository name, so both also built the path QNFO/[object Object] (the recorder returned before its first read, the visibility call would have answered 404); both now name qnfo-workers as mainRulesVisibility does. Both now read body.workflow_runs through workflowRuns(), and a non-200 answer is recorded as status http_<n> instead of reading as no runs. model-floor-guard-visibility.test.mjs. // 0.7.0 PROTECTION-VISIBLE-1 (agent_issues 2927 INTEG-GITHUB-HARDEN-1, pillar security): the branch-protection step ignored every answer except 404 and 200, so a credential that cannot read protection (403 "Resource not accessible by integration") produced repos_protected 0, errors 0 and drift 0 for every run since 2026-10-17 while 55 public repositories stayed unprotected. A GET that answers anything else is now counted (result.protection_unreadable: count, status map, GitHub's own text, an example repository) and written as one limitation; and the run records the rules that apply to QNFO/qnfo-workers main (result.main_rules: status, rule types, whether required_status_checks and pull_request are among them; one public GET), so the DoD of 2927 is a number in github_steward_runs.detail on every tick. // 0.6.0 CRON-GRID-1 (owner directive 2026-10-19, pillar autonomy): the tracker tick moves to the 5-minute grid (:05, :15 ... :55) and the repository reconcile runs hourly on the :15 fire (it ran every 6 hours on its own trigger). Every fire is logged to cron_fire_log for CRON-WATCH-1. // 0.5.0 TRACKER-DRAIN-1 (agent_issues 2940 follow-up): ISSUE-SYNC-FORWARD-1 closes the GitHub issue of a resolved worker-observability dispatch row (and reopens it on a recurrence, before the reverse leg can swallow it); the state sync runs oldest D1 change first inside a time/subrequest budget and stops on 403/429 instead of a flat 20; the mass-flip guard refuses only unexplained disagreement (explained = D1 moved across open/closed since the link last agreed, not an updated_at window); a 403 stops the tick only when GitHub says rate limit (one shared flag), a per-issue 403 is skipped; the subrequest budget counts D1 calls; one status mapping (monitoring is closed not_planned naming its twin, never a completed close with no evidence); superseded attempt PRs outside the recent window are matched by stem and recorded with head_ref and task_ref; v_tracker_drift gains age_min and metric tracker_drift_oldest_min. // 0.4.8 TRACKER-REPAIR-ROUND-1 (agent_issues 2940): a codeagent-<stem>-rN pull request of an earlier repair round is matched to its task by the branch stem, so it is no longer pr-without-task drift. // 0.4.6 PORTFOLIO-HEARTBEAT-1 (2026-10-18): publish the portfolio run as in_progress BEFORE the work, so a tick killed by the CPU budget is distinguishable from a record that was never writtenIVENESS-1 (2026-10-18): this worker, on its own 10-minute cron and outside the qnfo-code-orchestrator process, reads the freshest fleet_crons.last_fired and files liveness:dispatcher-stalled when the per-minute dispatcher has been quiet for over 20 minutes -- the one stall no watchdog inside that failure domain can report, because NEVER-STALL-1 is itself a fleet_cron dispatched by the tick it would be reporting on. // 0.4.4 NOTIFY-ATTEMPT-TITLE-1 (2026-10-18): a re-run notification title ("workflow run, Attempt #2 failed") is parsed like the first attempt, so its resolved thread is cleared (three were kept at 10:52Z). // 0.4.3 TRACKER-SYNC-1: stale pr-without-task rows are cleared every tick; a merge fix reads merged_by from the single PR; 0.4.2 TRACKER-SYNC-1: the recent-PR window is a deliberate partial read (every post-backfill tick refused it); 0.4.1 org projects declared on (the portfolio board needs them); 0.4.0 PORTFOLIO-SYNC-1: projects derived from the census, metric breaches as roadmap objectives, programs/projects/issues/roadmap mirrored to GitHub labels, milestones, issues and a Projects board every 10 minutes; 0.3.1 a task is matched to its PR by number too (pr-without-task false positive on PR 381); 0.3.0 TRACKER-SYNC-1: agent_issues <-> GitHub issues and code_tasks <-> PRs every 10 minutes (0.2.2 ISSUE-SYNC-1)
