-- IL-NONFIX-CLOSURE-1 (2026-11-05, pillar autonomy; metrics fix_hold_rate_30d, issue_relapse_families_7d, open_agent_issues). Companion of qnfo-fleet-control 0.67.1 (same pull request).
-- WHAT WAS READ (qnfo-audit, 2026-11-05 04Z): the improvement loop installs a post-close monitor (module improvement-relapse, class metric-relapse-<id>) on every closed METRIC-TRIGGER ticket and
--   judges it "did the fix hold". 67 of the 276 such closures of the last 31 days were closed as superseded by a successor ticket or as moot, which fixes nothing: 27 of the 48 relapses behind
--   fix_hold_rate_30d 0.6923 (108 held of 156) were them, and a monitor on a metric that is still off its trigger reopens the closed ticket the day after (the loop issue 2816 needed
--   migrations/2026-11-02-orphan-metric-successor.sql to stop by hand). The worker no longer judges or monitors such closures; this file settles the monitors it had already installed.
-- WHAT THIS FILE ADDS: every improvement-relapse monitor in status active, holding or escalated on a CLOSED issue whose close_evidence starts with "superseded" or "moot:" (any case) is set to
--   status superseded, last_verdict superseded:nonfix-closure; before-state in bak_20261105_il_nonfix_monitors. Plus the detector fm-nonfix-relapse-monitor (expected 0), which also catches
--   the monitors the loop writes between this file and the worker deploy.
-- Prediction: fix_hold_rate_30d rises from 0.6923 to >= 0.8 at the first improvement tick after the 0.67.1 deploy (about 98 held of 119 judged); no closed superseded or moot ticket reopens on a relapse
--   contract; closes_7d and reopens_7d of the METRIC-TRIGGER family fall together.
