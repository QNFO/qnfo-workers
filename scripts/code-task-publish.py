"""code-task-publish.py -- CODE-TASK-PUBLISH-1: PULL-BASED PR publishing for the qnfo-code-orchestrator loop.

WHY
  The orchestrator worker (and any session) holds no GitHub PR-write credential and a session cannot mint one,
  so a human sat on the critical path between "verified patch" and "PR". The GitHub Actions GITHUB_TOKEN already has
  contents: write + pull-requests: write for this repo. So the worker PARKS the verified patch in D1
  (code_tasks.status = 'ready_to_publish', patch in ctx.patch) and this script PULLS it from a workflow run.

WHAT IT DOES (per ready task of THIS repo)
  claim (ready_to_publish -> publishing, compare-and-set) -> re-check path policy -> reuse an existing PR for the
  branch if one exists (idempotent) -> else `git apply --check` + apply on a fresh branch off origin/main -> commit ->
  push -> open PR -> record status='published' + pr_url.  Any failure records status='publish_failed' with last_error.
  Then (PR-OUTCOME-RECONCILE-1) it reads the state of each published / branch_pushed / pr_open task's PR and records
  status='merged' or 'closed' once a person has merged or closed it.

PR OPENED BY THE FLEET (CODE-TASK-MERGE-RUNNER-1, CODE_TASK_PR_OPENER=qnfo-fleet-control)
  A PR opened with the Actions GITHUB_TOKEN starts no pull_request workflow, so its required checks never run, and this
  workflow holds no other GitHub credential. With CODE_TASK_PR_OPENER=qnfo-fleet-control (set in code-task-publish.yml)
  the script pushes the branch and stops at status='branch_pushed' with the compare URL; qnfo-fleet-control opens the PR
  with the fleet's own token within the hour (CI then starts by itself) and merges it when the checks and its gates pass.
  An existing PR for the branch is still adopted. Without the variable the script opens the PR itself, as before.
  It NEVER merges, never force-pushes, never touches main, never deletes rows, and uses no credential other than the
  environment's (CF_ACCOUNT_ID / CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN for D1, GH_TOKEN for gh). No secret value is read or printed.

EXIT  0 = nothing failed (including "no tasks").  1 = at least one task ended publish_failed (loud, never silent).
      2 = configuration/transport error (could not read the queue).

# `var VERSION` in qnfo-fleet-dashboard/worker.js replaces ONE 202,642-char line (the release notes ride on it as a comment) and
# the same line in the deployed-current mirror, so even a 4-line edit is a ~816,000-char patch (removed plus added, twice): 5 of 5
# code tasks on that file ended "publish: patch larger than 200000 chars" on 2026-10-19 (qnfo-fleet-control's VERSION line is
# 199,469 chars, the same arithmetic). 1_000_000 passes those patches; a whole-file fallback for a 1.2 MB worker (2.4 MB) and any
# runaway patch stay refused, and ctx plus patch still fit one D1 row (limit 2 MB).
# PATCH-CAP-1500K-1 (2026-10-19, agent_issues 100227): 1_000_000 was 22,726 chars short for qnfo-fleet-control. COST-GUARD-BLIND-2 (issue 100185,
# ct_qlk9bm3gwuo7cb) is a real edit plus the same two ~203,400-char VERSION lines (worker and mirror, removed and added): a 1,022,726-char patch, a
# ctx of 1,051,332 chars, three publish_failed attempts and a LOOP-BREAKER-1 issue. The release notes on those lines grow with every release (each
# bump adds about 4 x 5,000 chars), so the cap carries headroom of about 20 releases instead of a margin of 2 percent. 1_500_000 still refuses a
# whole-file fallback with its mirror for any worker over 375 KB (4 x the file size) and keeps ctx plus patch under one D1 row (2 MB). Pruning the
# release notes off the VERSION line would remove the pressure at its source; that is a separate change.

# unmerged. A lane is a worker's worker.js (its mirror counts as the same lane) or, for any other file, that file. While a task of the lane has
# an open branch or pull request, the next one stays ready_to_publish and publishes against the main that already holds its predecessor, so it
# applies without a conflict. Tasks of different lanes still publish together. A failed in-flight read publishes ungated: the loop never stops
