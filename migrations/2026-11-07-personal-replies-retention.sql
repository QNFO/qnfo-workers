-- KERNEL-EVERYWHERE-1 follow-up: bound personal_replies growth (#8474)

-- personal_replies mirrors every personal-api twin reply for false-stop scanning.
-- It was unbounded (one row per reply, kept forever). This adds a 30-day retention
-- sweep so the table stays bounded while preserving the 7-day false_stops_7d window.

-- Backup existing rows before adding retention sweep
