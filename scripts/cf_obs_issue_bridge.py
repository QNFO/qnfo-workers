"""CF-OBS-BRIDGE-1 (2026-10-18, owner directive "INTEGRATE CLOUDFLARE OBSERVABILITY ISSUES INTO UNIFIED TRACKING, AUDITING, AND
REMEDIATION. THE SYSTEM SHALL AUTOMATICALLY SWEEP FOR ALL KNOWN ISSUES AND RESOLVE AUTOMATICALLY").

WHAT  Closes the loop between Cloudflare Workers Observability Issues and the fleet's own tracker:
      1. SWEEP   reads every page of /workers/observability/issues?status=active (Cloudflare API, read).
      2. TRACK   every live group (seen within FILE_H hours, i.e. not yet quiet; not external scan noise) gets ONE open agent_issues row
                 "CF-OBS-ISSUE-1: <service>: <title>", deduped on the Cloudflare id carried in its description, with:
                   - a code-task line for <service>/worker.js when that file exists, so the code loop attempts the fix;
                   - its issue-<id> contract re-pointed at a d1-query probe that passes once the group has not recurred for
                     QUIET_H hours (read from fleet_issue_dispatch, which qnfo-fleet-control pollObservability refreshes
                     every 10 minutes). The existing autoclose trigger then closes the issue with verified evidence.
      3. RESOLVE when a CF-OBS-ISSUE-1 issue is closed by verification and its group has been quiet QUIET_H hours, the
                 group is PATCHed to status=resolved in Cloudflare. Cloudflare re-activates a resolved group on its next
                 occurrence, and the next sweep then files a fresh issue (relapse is visible, never silent).
      CF-OBS-BRIDGE-LOOP-1 (2026-10-19): FILE and RESOLVE share one boundary. Before, a group was filed while seen within 24 h but
      the issue's own probe closed it after 6 h quiet, so a group quiet for 6 to 24 h was closed by the probe, filed again by the next
      sweep (the D1 trigger issue_refile_reopen reopens a title closed within 24 h) and closed again, while the RESOLVE step only
      ran on rows the FILE step had just reopened: 145 reopens on 27 issues in 24 h and no group told 'resolved'. Now a group quiet
      for FILE_H or more is never filed (a closed one is PATCHed resolved at once), and a title closed within 24 h is not filed again
      unless the group was observed after the close (a relapse, which the trigger reopens and the sweep counts as relapsed).
      One run row per sweep in cloud_ops_events (kind cf-obs-bridge); the fm-cf-obs-untracked contract audits the gap.
WHY   Before this, pollObservability mirrored groups into fleet_issue_dispatch, but nothing turned a live group into a tracked,
      probed, closable issue, so 29 groups sat active (3824 occurrences) while the remediation loop never saw them.
      A failing PATCH, closed-issue SELECT or Cloudflare list read is counted in `errors` and never skips the churn metric or the run row
      (they are written in a finally); the suite is a PR gate in deploy-gate.yml and the consumer runs the sweep even if it fails.
RUNS  A step of remediation-consumer.yml (runner, depth 0: an agent_issues insert from a D1 trigger nests past D1's limit).
      Deterministic, no model call. Never fails the job.
