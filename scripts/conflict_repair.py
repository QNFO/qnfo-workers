"""conflict_repair.py -- CONFLICT-REPAIR-DOER-1 (agent_issues 2305, charter pillar: autonomy).

WHAT  The doer for STALE-PR-CONFLICT-REPAIR-1 issues (qnfo-fleet-control files one per quiet pull request that conflicts with
      its base branch). For one pull request it
        1. reads the pull request (open, same repository, not a draft, `mergeable_state: dirty`);
        2. branches `repair/pr-<n>-<head sha7>` from its base branch and merges the pull request's head into it without committing;
        3. resolves what can be resolved without judgement, keeping the base branch's meaning everywhere else:
             - a conflict whose every hunk is only the `var VERSION = "..."` line of a worker.js takes the pull request's
               line (the next step bumps it), which is how nearly every conflict on this repository arises: two changes to
               one worker each bump the same line;
             - deployed-current.worker.js is never merged: it is rewritten from the resolved worker.js (mirror-guard);
             - anything else is a semantic overlap. The merge is aborted, nothing is pushed, and the outcome is
               `needs-session` with the files, so the issue stays open for a doer that can read the code;
        4. bumps each changed worker's VERSION above what the base branch and every other open pull request claim (VERSION-AHEAD-1);
        5. runs the checks a pull request gets: node --check, the changed workers' suites (scripts/run-suites.mjs),
           mirror-guard, version-bump-guard and the workers-standards guard;
        6. with --push: pushes the branch, opens the replacement pull request naming the old one, dispatches the check
           workflows that accept a dispatch (a pull_request run on a GITHUB_TOKEN push starts no job, see DISPATCHABLE),
           comments on the old pull request and closes it as superseded by the new number.
      Every run writes one cloud_ops_events row (kind conflict-repair-reapplied, status ok | warn) and a branch_hygiene_log
      row; a pull request head that was already re-applied and pushed is skipped. An --all run also writes an hourly
      heartbeat row (id conflict-repair-tick-<UTC hour>) so the watchmaker can prove the doer ran.
      It never merges, never force-pushes, never touches main, and refuses a pull request that changes .github/ (the
      Actions token may not push workflow files).
USAGE python3 scripts/conflict_repair.py --pr <n> [--push] [--keep-branch]
      python3 scripts/conflict_repair.py --all [--push] [--max 3]      every open STALE-PR-CONFLICT-REPAIR-1 issue's pull request
      python3 scripts/conflict_repair.py --selftest
      Reads GH_TOKEN (gh), CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN and CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (ledger rows; skipped with a warning when absent).
      Exit 0 unless the arguments are wrong: an outcome is data, written to the ledger and printed as JSON.

# PR-GUARD-FIXES-1 (2026-10-20, agent_issues 100295): a push with GITHUB_TOKEN does not "start no pull_request workflow". GitHub creates the
# pull_request runs for the pusher github-actions[bot] and they never start a job: run 39318576612 (version-compare, PR 3106, created
# 2026-10-19T20:21:07Z by this script's push) has 0 jobs, run_attempt 1, and was concluded `failure` at 22:34:28Z, the second the pull
# request merged. The 2026-10-20 audit counted 36 such runs over PRs 2901, 2986, 3056, 3100 and 3106 (six workflows each), failed when
# their pull request closed or merged, with no guard run on the repaired head. The wait is inferred to be an approval gate (the audit
# read `action_required` on attempt 1 of sibling runs, which passed at once on a person's re-run, attempt 2), and nobody clicks it. A
# workflow_dispatch run on the same head does start, so the checks the merge lane requires are dispatched here. mirror-guard.yml
# (check `mirror-guard`, in EVOLVE_REQUIRED of qnfo-fleet-control) was missing, so a repaired head had no mirror-guard result until a
# person re-ran it: PR 3106 waited four hours. A dispatched mirror-guard run is the strict global audit (no --scope-to-diff), so it
# reads the whole tree of the repaired head.
# Failed-run accounting must not count the zero-job runs: a pull_request run by github-actions[bot] with 0 jobs and conclusion failure,
# ending the second its pull request closed or merged, is a gate artifact and no verdict on the change. (ci_watchdog.py classes a
# zero-job run as invalid-workflow, so it would misdiagnose these if its scope widened from main to pull-request branches.)

# PHANTOM-RUN-CLEAR-1 (2026-10-26, owner directive "remediate all failing workflows"; corrects PHANTOM-RUN-CANCEL-1 of the same day): the zero-job
# pull_request runs described above were two thirds of every failure on the Actions page (56 of 84 in 24 h: seven repaired pull request heads x
# eight workflows). MEASURED on the next repair push (claude/project-thread-0hsmo1, 06:58Z): they are approval-gated runs, status `completed`,
# conclusion `action_required`, zero jobs, by github-actions[bot]; GitHub concludes them `failure` the second the pull request closes. A
# completed run cannot be cancelled (HTTP 409), so the first version of this step, which cancelled only runs that were not completed, caught
# none of them. A completed zero-job run carries no verdict and no log, so it is deleted (HTTP 204 for a completed run); a run that is still in
# flight is cancelled. The first version approved nothing: the approval gate is a security control (POST .../approve starts such a run for real, measured
# once as a probe) and relaxing it was the owner's decision; the owner has since decided it (OWNER-AUTO-APPROVE-ALL-1 below). The dispatched workflow_dispatch runs are another
# event and are never touched.
# OWNER-AUTO-APPROVE-ALL-1 (2026-10-26): the owner answered "Yes, auto-approve all" to the question whether a repair push's approval-gated runs may be approved instead of
# deleted. They are now approved (POST .../approve), so the pull_request checks run for real on the repaired head and the pull request no longer carries a failed zero-job run when
# it closes. Only a run of THIS push (head_sha), of THIS repository's own branch (head_repository), event pull_request, by github-actions[bot], concluded action_required with zero
# jobs is approved: a fork run, a person's run and a dispatched run are never touched. An approval GitHub refuses falls back to the deletion above. CONFLICT_REPAIR_APPROVE=off
# restores "nothing is approved" without a deploy of anything but the workflow env.
