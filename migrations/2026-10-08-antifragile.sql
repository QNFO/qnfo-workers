-- ANTIFRAGILE-1 (2026-10-08, pillar autonomy). Owner directive 2026-10-08, verbatim: "the system shall audit and remove all
-- such holds, filters, and blocks systemwide across the fleet ... all such blockers and assumptions shall be subject to
-- adversarial red-team never assume an issue is an issue without sufficient adversarial evidence. Workarounds almost always
-- exist. The system shall always build a robust system with redundant paths never a fragile one dependent on a single
-- critical path. The system shall track and regularly check all issue dates and shall immediately flag and remediate those
-- over one cycle/run/day old (and/or one tick). The system shall continuously and aggressivlely root out and eliminate false
-- beliefs and incorrect assumptions. Independent autonomy is now a bare minimum, aggressive robustness and anti-fragility
-- shall also be integrated systemwide across the fleet."
--
-- Done by session_01CWLpf5v1NjC9GXbM6rnH4k before this file (data, backup bak_20261008_hold_release, reverts in each row):
-- 19 research_queue owner_hold rows and 8 rows parked after model outages re-queued; 31 held ideas (2 owner notebook, 29
-- re-entry) accepted and queued. Code holds filed as code-tasks #2173 (owner score bar) and #2174 (re-entry expiry becomes a
-- 2/day rate limit); the single-path research executor as #2175. False belief corrected: card cf-dns-redirect-token said no
-- fleet token could write routes; the repository token had done so on 2026-10-02 (CLAUDE.md, QUEUE-SLA-1 PR).
--
-- This file makes the rest continuous (all on Cloudflare; runs on queue_sla_tick_10m's heartbeat row, QUEUE-SLA-1):
-- (1) Issue dates: v_issue_age lists every open issue with its age in minutes and hours. An issue open more than 24 hours
--     whose priority is low or medium rises one level per 24 hours (issue_age_bumps is the ledger and the revert), so the
--     master queue v_issue_queue serves it before newer work. Critical is never set by age; high is the ceiling.
-- (2) Red team of blockers: v_blocker_claims lists open issues and open owner cards whose text asserts a blocker ("owner
--     only", "needs a token", "no token", "needs the owner", "cannot be done", "blocked", "session-task:") that is older
--     than 60 minutes and has no blocker_redteam verdict in 24 hours. Metric unverified_blocker_claims (target 0); its
--     trigger tells the doer to attempt the action with the credentials and paths that exist and record the result.
-- (3) Research backlog age: queue_sla row research-queued-age (SLA 180 min); v_stuck_summary.research_queued_180m (QUEUE-SLA-1
--     file) counts it in stuck_items_over_sla, so a queue the single executor cannot drain is a breach until #2175 adds the
--     second path. (Kept in the view, not in this trigger: two triggers on one insert fire in no guaranteed order.)
-- (4) Metric issues_open_over_24h (target 0) with a trigger naming the escalation ladder.
