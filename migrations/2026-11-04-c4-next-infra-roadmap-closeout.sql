-- CF-ESTATE-1 / NEXT-QNFO.INFRA.* closeout (2026-11-05, charter pillars core, cost and security; session c4-next of the 2026-11-04 roadmap completion sweep).
-- roadmap_implementation rows 610 (QNFO.INFRA.WORK), 611 (PAGE), 612 (DNS), 613 (D1) and 614 (R2) were opened by portfolio-self-manage on 2026-10-18 with the definition of done
-- "name the next concrete deliverable and map work to it, or retire the project with a reason": portfolio-execute cannot advance an active curated project that has no issue mapped to
-- it (fleet_tasks portfolio-execute step no-mapped-work). What this file does, for each of the five projects:
--   1. the deliverable of this change is scripts/cf_estate.py (workflow cf-estate, five read-only actions, offline suite scripts/cf_estate_test.py): worker-inventory, pages-inventory,
--      dns-drift, d1-query-report, r2-inventory, plus docs/DOMAINS.md brought in line with the account (11 served hosts were missing from its table);
--   2. files the NEXT slice as an agent_issues row with a code-task, a code-anchor and a code-probe, so a doer exists (the code loop), and maps it to the project in issue_project_map
--      (the steward keeps an open issue on an active catalogue project that is not a W.<worker> project, PS-KEEP-CATALOGUE-PROJECT-1);
--   3. sets the roadmap row to partial with the evidence read on 2026-11-04 (portfolio-self-manage / roadmap-self-maintain verify a NEXT- row on mapped work by themselves; this text is
--      the record of what was built and what is not yet verified live).
-- The note on the rows that agent_issues INSERT failed with "triggers nested too deep" is stale: ids up to 1001850 were inserted on 2026-11-04 (the last at 22:54Z) and this file inserts five.

The cap trigger is gt 30, so the breach stays until the fleet is under 30; this removes the one script that is not a fleet worker from the count.

Evidence (python3 scripts/cf_estate.py worker-inventory, workflow cf-estate, replayed on the live account 2026-11-04): 39 account scripts, 1 tombstone (qnfo-workers: worker_live_audit http 410 TOMBSTONE_410, service_registry state retired since 2026-11-04T23:00Z), 38 fleet workers; registry disagreement raw [qnfo-workers], tombstone-aware []. cloud_ops_events worker-count-2026-11-04: worker count: 39 live scripts, 38 registry rows live, disagreement 1: only live qnfo-workers. The stub cannot be deleted: the Workers Builds integration recreates it on every push (agent_issues 1000156 records it, registry side). Two further scripts have no source directory here: qnfo-fleet-lee and voice-stt (classified unmanaged, not changed by this issue).

Change: in qnfo-fleet-control/worker.js give workerCountDiff a third argument tombstones (script names whose worker_live_audit row has http 410 or a TOMBSTONE note and whose service_registry state is retired); remove them from the live list, the registry list and the live count. oneWorkerCount reads SELECT worker FROM worker_live_audit WHERE http = 410 and passes the names; the worker-count event text names the tombstones. Regression test in qnfo-fleet-control/one-worker-count.test.mjs: a live script with http 410 and a retired registry row leaves live, registry and disagreement unchanged; a live script with http 410 and a live registry row is not excluded. Bump with python scripts/worker_release.py bump qnfo-fleet-control.

Evidence (pages-inventory, replayed on the live account 2026-11-04): 7 Pages projects. q08-archive: no custom domain, last deploy 2026-09-26, no workflow names it, no code names q08-archive.pages.dev; its page is a 1.1 KB q08.org archived notice. Verdict review, not retire: qnfo-landing (radar-hub/worker.js and qnfo-cloud-ops/worker.js name qnfo-landing.pages.dev; repoint or drop those first) and ask-qwav (ask.qwav.tech is answered by the qnfo-ai-search route: the two bodies differ, 51 KB against 11 KB; scripts/attach-ask-qwav-route.py replaced the project; detach the custom domain, then retire). keep: qwav, qnfo-publications, qnfo-hub, active: qwav-demo-bt-qec.

Change: add action delete-pages-project NAME to scripts/cf_ops_actions.py, modelled on delete_vectorize_index: refused unless scripts/cf_estate.py classify_pages gives NAME the verdict retire-candidate (fresh Pages list, fresh repo scan), refused when the project has a custom domain, writes the project latest deployment file list (names and sizes, no content) to R2 qnfo-backups/pages-retired/NAME.json before the DELETE and verifies it by reading it back, prints the project it deleted. Offline test scripts/cf_ops_pages_retire_test.py with a fake API (each refusal, the backup before the delete, the verdict gate). Then run it for q08-archive and attach the pages-inventory re-run to this issue as the closing evidence. Add the action to .github/workflows/cf-ops-actions.yml in the same change.

Evidence (dns-drift replayed on the live account 2026-11-04, 66 documented hosts, 65 served, 0 missing, 0 undocumented after docs/DOMAINS.md was brought in line): dangling_target analytics.qnfo.org CNAME qnfo-analytics.q08.workers.dev (the script is gone, qnfo-analytics/RETIRED; the route analytics.qnfo.org/* to qnfo-lifecycle answers the host, so the record is dead weight); stray_redirect: zone qnfo.org carries the rule http.host eq primer.qwav.tech, which can never match there (primer.qwav.tech is in zone qwav.tech and has its own rule). delegation_lost qwave.tech and q-wave.tech is the lapsed registration of human_actions 102 (resolved) and is not fixed here. shadowed_pages: archive.qnfo.org, www.qnfo.org and ask.qwav.tech are listed on a Pages project and answered by a worker route (see the PAGE issue).

Change: add action dns-prune to scripts/cf_ops_actions.py, dry run by default (the write needs --model live): for each dangling_target CNAME of cf_estate.evaluate_dns whose host is also answered by a worker route or custom domain, and each stray redirect rule, write the record or rule JSON to R2 qnfo-backups/dns-pruned/ZONE-DATE.json (verified by read-back), then delete it.

'Charter pillar: core (D1 reliability), cost. Metric it should move: every D1 change that names a hot statement is verified by a stored same-window comparison (rows read of the top 5 tables), where today it is verified by a report that is gone with its job log.

Evidence: docs/D1-SPLIT-DESIGN-2026-11.md and docs/D1-CLOUD-OPS-EVENTS-2026-11.md both end in "re-run the same d1QueriesAdaptiveGroups query and compare"; until python3 scripts/cf_estate.py d1-query-report nothing ran it.

Without a stored baseline the next change cannot show that it helped.

Change: scripts/cf_estate.py d1-query-report gets --save (write the RESULT_JSON to R2 qnfo-backups/d1-query-report/DB/UTC-timestamp.json with the repository token; the one write cf_estate.py makes, limited to that prefix) and --baseline-r2 (read the newest earlier report of the same database and hours and pass it to compare_d1); the cf-estate workflow passes both. scripts/cf-estate.test.mjs is updated to allow that one PUT and nothing else.

'Charter pillar: security. Metric it should move: public_unexpected buckets of python3 scripts/cf_estate.py r2-inventory, 1 to 0.

Evidence (r2-inventory, replayed on the live account 2026-11-04): 19 buckets, 92.1 GB (docs/SYSTEM-MAP.md lists 12: it lists the bound ones). Two have r2.dev public access enabled: qnfo-assets (expected: the calendar .ics bearer URLs of qnfo-lifecycle and personal-companion) and qnfo (641 objects, 11.8 MB, bound by qnfo-gateway; no code, workflow or document in this repository names its r2.dev host pub-426be63219f54be3932467bcbaf805f5). Seven buckets have no worker binding and 50 or fewer requests in 30 days: deepchat 4.67 GB (owner client data), qnfo-ddocs 0.69 GB (its indexer is RETIRED), qnfo-projects, releases, git-repos, palimpsest-research, play-the-ball. The report deletes nothing.

Change: add action r2-public to scripts/cf_ops_actions.py: with no --model it prints the bucket managed r2.dev state; --model off or on sets it (PUT /accounts/ID/r2/buckets/NAME/domains/managed with enabled), prints the previous state so the switch is reversible (turning it on again brings back the same host), and refuses to turn off a bucket in cf_estate.R2_PUBLIC_EXPECTED. Offline test scripts/cf_ops_r2_public_test.py with a fake API. Before turning qnfo off, search the published corpus (living-paper papers.body_md) and the outreach text for the pub-426be63219f54be3932467bcbaf805f5 host and record the result here; if a document names it, leave it on and allowlist it in R2_PUBLIC_EXPECTED with the reason. The seven idle buckets stay with their owners: a delete needs a dependency check (S3 clients on the owner machine, runner scripts) and a backup first.
