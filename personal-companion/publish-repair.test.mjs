// reading.q08.org published nothing for 73h (companion_runs 4549-5339). In the 72h to 2026-10-13 05:16Z, 154 attempts were rejected:
// grounding 102, length 42, banned phrase 32, critique 17, fact-check 8 (an attempt can carry several). Proves: writer and critic calls
// skip the AI Gateway cache; a banned-phrase sentence is deleted instead of throwing the draft away (not when the phrase is in the title,
// and not past the quarter cap); a draft left only short after the repair is extended from its cleaned text; fact-check items are FACT or
// INFERENCE and only FACT items fail (unlabelled items stay FACT); the quoted FACT sentences are deleted and the draft is re-verified
// before any model revision, and an invented claim that cannot be deleted still stops publication; the notes critic no longer scores the
// placeholder objection; every essay and notes piece opens with a lede that names its subject and is not abstract framing.
