-- The 12 kaizen gate candidates of 2026-09-26/27 (kaizen_candidates rowid 34 to 45: ten read "promoted", two "proposed") were prose: promotion filed an improvement, nothing enforced the lesson.
-- Each now has an enforcer, read on 2026-11-05:
--   repository checks   scripts/kaizen_gates.py (strict fast guard "kaizen-gates" in scripts/pr_fast_guards.py, tests scripts/kaizen-gates.test.mjs):
--                       RED-INVENTORY-1, BUILD-GATE-NOT-RUNTIME-GATE-1, LIVE-AHEAD-OF-REPO-UNCOMMITTED-1 (tripwires on the enforcers they rely on), DEAD-SERVICE-BINDING-DEPLOY-BLOCK-1,
--                       CURRENCY-UNIT-TRAP-1, STALE-TEMPLATE-MODELKEY-1 (checks); GATEWAY-RUNWAY-BRAKE-1 and TEMPLATE-RUNTIME-INJECTION-PARITY-1 as command-line checks over a live input.
--   D1 detectors        this file: GOVERNANCE-CAP-DISPOSITION-1 (fleet_budget_disposition, v_fleet_budget_undisposed, fm-fleet-budget-undisposed), CLAIM-SHEET-DB-ENFORCEMENT-1
--                       (fm-claim-sheet-triggers), FLEET-VS-EXTERNAL-MISATTRIBUTION-1 (fm-cost-source-scope). REGISTRY-DRIFT-CONCURRENT-REMOVAL-1 is held by fm-registry-live-absent and the
--                       fleet-graph findings untracked-worker and undeployed-dir, both already live.
-- MEASURED while writing: fleet_budget holds four classes over their cap (workers 39 of 30, d1_databases 13 of 10, ai_spend:workers-ai 793.53 of 95, cost:fleet_all_in_month 1151.13 of 300), each already has a
-- doer (metric trigger 344, issue 1001824, triggers 354 and 10930); that link was nowhere recorded, which is the GOVERNANCE-CAP-DISPOSITION-1 gap. Found on the way: costImpactGuard (qnfo-fleet-control) has
-- ended all 39 daily runs since 2026-09-27 as "-failed", the last ones with HTTP 400 "Expected number, received nan" from a PUT that sends spend_limits only; filed below with its doer.
-- PREDICTION (decision_log): kaizen gate candidates held by a machine check 0 of 12 to 12 of 12; kaizen_candidates rowid 34 to 45 left "proposed" or "promoted": 12 to 0; the detectors read 0 within the hour after apply.
-- Falsifier: fm-fleet-budget-undisposed reads above 0 after apply (a breached class lost its doer) or a pull request is blocked by kaizen-gates for a violation the base tree does not have: revert with the Rollback line.
