-- C4-FM2-LEVER-NONANCHOR-GATE-1 (2026-11-05, charter pillar autonomy; roadmap_implementation 1755 FM-2, agent_issues 1000718; follow-up of PR 7398 and 7438).
-- Row 1755 asks that a code-task from an agent answer pass an anchor check before it is stored. The check that exists is the model's own (the root-cause prompt, probe 1000718) and the code loop's
-- locator at intake (ANCHOR-LOCATOR-1, which absorbs an anchor that occurs 0 or 2+ times). Read 2026-11-05T01:00Z: the lever review is the path that stores agent code-tasks in issue descriptions
-- (management-personas-c lever-report appends a reply that holds `code-task: repo=qnfo-workers path=`, `code-anchor:` and `EDIT:`), 52 issues carry such a block, 19 of them open with an anchor line, and of
-- 13 open ones checked against main 2 resolve exactly once as stored, 5 after stripping backticks and 8 not at all: two of the eight are the model's own admission that it has no anchor, stored as a task:
--   1000391  code-task path `qnfo-agents/src/ (lever-review / ... exact file NOT read in this turn)`, code-anchor: NOT ESTABLISHED - I did not read the producer source, and I will not supply an unverified anchor.
--   1001373  code-task path migrations/2026-11-04-iar-r1-live-doer-verify-semicolon.sql (a file that does not exist), code-anchor: not quotable - the playbook-insert migration's text was never read.
-- The other six (a comment line that moved, a trigger line, three `; code-anchor:` inline forms, escaped quotes) need the file to be judged and are left to the locator: the 2 of 2 stored doer anchors
-- that occur 0 times on main (issues 99930 and 100464) have merged tasks. A file-reading check at store time would live in qnfo-agents finishRequest, claimed by another session; not built.
-- What this file builds is the part SQL can decide: a reply whose code-anchor line starts with `not` (case-insensitive: NOT ESTABLISHED, not captured, not quotable, NOT VERIFIED) is the model saying it
-- has no anchor, so it is not a lever reply. In management-personas-c the lever-request (a usable reply in the last 3 days stops a new request), lever-report (appends) and lever-mark (marks a reply
-- 'empty', which the request step answers with a new request inside lever_per_trigger_daily and lever_daily_cap) all carry the same predicate six times; each gets
-- `AND COALESCE(r.result, '') NOT LIKE '%code-anchor: not %'` after the code-anchor test. The two stored blocks lose their task marker (code-task and code-anchor lose the colon), so the issues read doer-less again
-- and the doer-gap chain (dg-request) can assign one. fm-diagnosis-unresolved-anchor now also counts open issues whose description holds such an anchor line (expected 0).
-- Prediction: the two issues leave `instr(lower(description), 'code-anchor: not ') > 0`; no further lever reply with a non-anchor is appended (2 of 52 stored so far); lever_requests per day stay inside the caps;
-- guards remediation_latest_pass_pct_7d (62.7), issue_wontfix_share_7d (0.0) and agents_lever_usable_share_48h (counts EDIT: or CORRECTED TARGET:, unchanged) not worse.
-- Falsified if a lever reply that names a real anchor on a line starting with `not` is rejected (none of 52 stored blocks does).
