"""MIGRATION-RUNNER-1 (transformation lever T5.3, pillar autonomy): merged migrations apply themselves.

WHAT   A migration file opts in with two header lines:
           -- APPLY-BY: ci
           -- DB: qnfo-audit
       and must carry a rollback line in its header comments ("-- Rollback: ..."). Every DELETE FROM / DROP TABLE /
       DROP INDEX / DROP VIEW statement additionally needs a "-- BACKUP: <table>" line; the named table must exist in the
       same database and hold at least one row before the first destructive statement runs (no data is deleted without a
       backup). A file may create its own backup ("CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] <table> AS SELECT ...") ahead of the first
       destructive statement; then the check runs right before that statement, otherwise before anything runs.
       --check validates opted-in files (the PR gate). --apply runs them on Cloudflare D1 statement by statement and records
       each run in qnfo-audit.migration_runs (file, sha256, commit, status, statements, error); a file whose sha256 already
       has an ok run is skipped, so a re-run or a hand-applied twin is harmless (migrations here are idempotent by
       convention). A failed file records the error, files one deduped agent_issues row (MIGRATION-APPLY-FAILED-1: <file>)
       and exits 1, so the workflow turns red and ci-watchdog sees it.
WHY    On 2026-10-06 all 75 files under migrations/ had been applied by hand by the session that wrote them; nothing
       recorded which ones ran, and a merged migration that nobody applied was invisible. Files without the header are
       ignored, so nothing already applied runs again.
USAGE  python3 scripts/apply_migrations.py --check  migrations/a.sql [...]
       python3 scripts/apply_migrations.py --apply  migrations/a.sql [...] [--commit SHA]
       --apply reads CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN and CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID. Exit 0 = every opted-in file passed (or was skipped).
HEADERLESS (MIGRATION-HEADER-GUARD-1, 2026-10-19): a file with no "APPLY-BY: ci" used to be skipped without a word, so a migration
       that forgot the header was never applied (2026-10-18-subscribers-utm-attribution.sql: its columns were missing live while the
       code that reads them shipped). --check now refuses a file whose SQL contains an executable statement (ALTER, CREATE,
       INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, REPLACE) and that declares neither "-- APPLY-BY: ci" nor "-- APPLY-BY: manual (<reason>)" /
       "-- APPLY-BY: none (<reason>)". The files that already existed are listed in migrations/headerless-allowlist.txt
       (shrink-only: a file that gains a header leaves the list). --apply is unchanged and still skips a file without "ci".
PARSE-LINT (APPLY-MIGRATIONS-LINT-1, 2026-10-20): plan() also prepares every statement with EXPLAIN in an in-memory SQLite and refuses a
       file when SQLite cannot parse one (syntax error, unrecognized token, incomplete input, unterminated); a missing table, column or
       function is not a parse error and is ignored, so the lint needs no schema. A statement D1 refuses at parse time used to pass --check
       and fail on main (migrations/2026-10-18-portfolio-lifecycle.sql, migration_runs 288: unquoted text in a VALUES list). A file that
       needs syntax newer than the runner's SQLite says so on a "-- PARSE-LINT: off (<reason>)" header line; the lint is also skipped, and
       says so in the --check line, when the runner's SQLite is older than PARSE_LINT_MIN_SQLITE.
BACKUP-SCHEMA-ONLY (2026-10-20): an empty BACKUP table stops a file only when the file deletes rows (DELETE FROM, DROP TABLE). A file
       whose destructive statements are all DROP TRIGGER / DROP INDEX / DROP VIEW loses no row, so an empty backup is accepted for it.

# statement 2 listed unquoted text in a VALUES clause (PORTFOLIO-LIFECYCLE-1: maintain, implement, ...); D1 answered 'unrecognized token ":"
# at offset 167' (migration_runs 288, apply-migrations run 39126889193) and the fix landed seven minutes later. Every statement is now
# prepared with EXPLAIN in an in-memory SQLite (nothing runs, nothing is written) and the file is refused when the PARSER rejects one.
# Only parse-class messages count. EXPLAIN resolves names after parsing, so "no such table", "no such column", "no such function" and
# the other schema questions of an empty database are ignored: the lint needs no schema and cannot disagree with D1 about what exists.
# Measured 2026-10-20 on origin/main (SQLite 3.45.1, the ubuntu-latest runner's): it flags the e7d8b482 bytes of statement 2 with the same
# text D1 returned ('unrecognized token: ":"'), refuses 0 of the 437 opted-in migrations (2735 statements) and 0 of the 447 distinct sha256
# values migration_runs holds as ok (2841 statements); of the 671 historical contents of migrations/*.sql it refuses only that one. Two ways
# a dialect gap could still produce a false refusal are closed here: an older SQLite than PARSE_LINT_MIN_SQLITE skips the lint (and the
# --check line says so), and a file that needs syntax newer than the runner's SQLite carries "-- PARSE-LINT: off (<reason>)".
# Limit, stated plainly: the parser stops at its first error of any kind, so a name-resolution error SQLite raises WHILE parsing (a duplicate
# column, a trigger on a missing table) hides a later syntax error in the same statement. The trigger case is the common one, because a
# trigger's table is looked up before its body is read: a stand-in table (or view, for INSTEAD OF) is created for it in the throwaway
# database, which lets the body be parsed too (a column or table the body names is only resolved when the trigger fires, so none is needed).
