// q08-mind — mind.q08.org  (2.2.0)
// A reading list for the inside. Primary sources, one question each, and a probe.
//
// MIND-BOOKS-1 (2.2.0, 2026-10-26, pillar personal; minor: new pages and a new data product). The owner asked (2026-10-21) for
// "another subdomain of Q08 that really helps me understand myself better ... I'm not really into New Age or guru type shit ...
// figure out what I can read that will help me understand myself and my own perceived condition and place in life". The 2.1.0
// corpus answered with papers and scale validations: right as evidence, wrong as reading. 2.2.0 puts a reading list first
// (data/books.json: books, memoir and essays under his three questions, each with why, an honest caveat and a lane), keeps the
// papers as "the evidence underneath", and adds /now, today's pick in a lane. The companion at me.q08.org links to
// /now?lane=gentle|steady|deep chosen from his own mood record; only the lane name arrives here, nothing is stored, and the
// pick is a pure function of the date and the lane, so this worker stays binding-free.
// Binding-free by design: no D1/KV/R2/AI/service bindings, no outbound fetches,
// no client-side JavaScript. The corpus is data (data/entries-*.json), so a wrong
// entry is fixed by editing JSON, never by editing rendering code.
//
// MIND-Q08-3 (2026-10-21): every entry carries an evidence grade and, where one
// exists, a real effect size. The evidence shelf exists so the reader can
// calibrate the rest of the corpus. Instruments are labelled as instruments.

<h2>What is on the list</h2>
<p>Books, memoirs and essays that are well regarded by people who study the mind or who write honestly about their own. Every entry says what it is good for and what to watch out for: a finding that did not replicate, a theory that is still argued about, a memoir that describes something hard. Self-help is included only where it was tested, or where it is honest about being opinion.</p>
<h2>Three questions</h2>

<h2>Three lanes</h2>
<p>${Object.values(LANES).map((v) => `<b>${esc(v[0])}</b>: ${esc(v[1])}`).join("<br>")}</p>
<h2>Today's pick</h2>
<p>Each day the pick moves to the next question, and within it to the next book in the lane, so over a few weeks you see the whole list without repeats. When you open it from your companion at me.q08.org, the companion chooses the lane from how you have been: gentle after a heavy day or two, deep after a steadier week, steady otherwise. Only the lane name travels in the link. Nothing about you is sent to this site or kept here.</p>
<h2>What this is not</h2>
<p>Not therapy and not diagnosis. A book can help you name and understand what is going on; it cannot replace a person who knows you. If things are hard, the guide at me.q08.org/guide lists who to call.</p>`;

<h2>Rules the corpus follows</h2>
<p>1. Every empirical entry names a primary source with a DOI or a publisher link. No secondary summaries.</p>
<p>2. Where a pooled estimate exists it is stated as a number: r, d, or a percentage. Direction without size is not a finding.</p>
<p>3. Claims that failed replication are kept, on their own shelf, at the same length as the claims that held. Removing them would flatter the rest.</p>
<p>4. No entry tells you who you are. Each one describes a mechanism and hands back a probe: a measurement you run, on yourself, that can come out either way.</p>
<p>5. Barnum statements are excluded by rule. If a sentence would be true of almost anyone, it is not in the corpus.</p>
<h2>What this is not</h2>
<p>Not diagnosis. Not treatment. Not a substitute for a clinician. No instrument here is scored for you, and none of them is a screening test. Self-report is a measurement with known error: it is retrospective, reconstructive, and sensitive to mood at the moment of answering. That is why the <a href="/outside">outside view</a> and the <a href="/record">record</a> exist.</p>
<h2>Reading a claim</h2>
<p>Ask three things in order: what was measured, in whom, and did anyone repeat it. A study of 40 undergraduates that measured a self-report of a feeling is a different object from a multi-lab replication that measured behaviour. Most popular claims about the mind fail the second or third question.</p>`;

}

function outsidePage() {
  const body = `<h1>The outside view</h1>
<p class="sub">Self-report has a blind spot with a known shape, and another person can see it.</p>
<p>The self–other knowledge asymmetry finding is that you are the better judge of your internal states, and other people are the better judges of your observable and evaluative traits. Neither of you is the better judge of everything. So for questions about how you come across, an informant is a better instrument than your own memory.</p>
<h2>A protocol</h2>
<p>Send this to two people who have seen you work or live closely for more than a year. Ask them to answer in writing, not in conversation, and to give one concrete example per answer. Tell them not to soften it; the softening is the measurement error.</p>
<div class="probe"><b>Ask them</b>
1. What do I do when I am under pressure that I do not seem to notice?<br>
2. What do I say I want, and what do my choices suggest I want?<br>
3. Where am I least accurate about myself?<br>
4. What do I do that I would deny doing?<br>
5. What have I changed in the last two years that I have not acknowledged?</div>
<p>Then answer the same five about yourself, before reading theirs. The gap between the two sets is the data. Do not argue with it; write down where it is largest and check it against your <a href="/record">record</a> for the same month.</p>
<p>Two cautions. Informants have their own biases, including politeness and the version of you they need. And a single informant is a single study; two who disagree with each other are more informative than two who agree.</p>`;

function recordPage() {
  const body = `<h1>The record</h1>
<p class="sub">Retrospective self-report is reconstruction. A contemporaneous record is measurement.</p>
<p>When you are asked how you felt last week, you do not retrieve the week; you build a summary from what is salient now, from your beliefs about yourself, and from the last thing that happened. This is why a diary written at the end of the month and a sample taken three times a day disagree, and why the sample is the better evidence.</p>
<h2>A protocol that costs four minutes a day</h2>
<p>Three times a day, at fixed times, write one line each for five fields. Fixed times matter: choosing when to record selects for the moments you notice, which is the bias you are trying to escape.</p>
<div class="probe"><b>Each sample</b>
1. Where I am, and what I am doing.<br>
2. Attention: on the task, on myself, or elsewhere.<br>
3. Feeling: two words, specific (not good or bad).<br>
4. What I want right now.<br>
5. One sentence I said or thought that I would not say aloud.</div>
<p>After two weeks, count rather than interpret: how many samples had attention elsewhere; which two feeling words recur; how often field 4 was about something other than the task in field 1. Counts survive; impressions do not.</p>
<h2>Why counts</h2>
<p>The mind-wandering literature works this way. Asking people how much they mind-wander produces a number that tracks their beliefs about themselves; sampling them during the day produces a different and more defensible number. Your own record should be built the second way.</p>
<p>Keep it out of this site. It is a sheet of paper or a local file: there is no data plane here, nothing is stored, and nothing is sent.</p>`;

// ---- WEBMCP-FLEET-1:BEGIN (sourced from _shared/webmcp.js; applied by scripts/webmcp-apply.mjs; do not edit inside a worker) ----
// WEBMCP-FLEET-1 (2026-10-25, pillar reach, owner directive "implement WebMCP systemwide across the fleet").
//
// WHAT. WebMCP (https://blog.cloudflare.com/webmcp/, August 2026) is a browser standard, shipping experimentally in
// Chrome 146, that appears in the page as document.modelContext: a site registers MCP tools with registerTool() so an
// agent visiting the page can call the site's own operations instead of guessing its way through a page built for
// humans. Cloudflare's developer preview offers a zone toggle that injects a bridge and two packs (c2pa, and a proxy
// to the site's own MCP server). That toggle is Dashboard-only and this fleet's token may not write zone Snippets
// (probed 2026-10-25: HTTP 403 "snippets are not allowed", and GET /user/tokens 403 so no wider token can be minted),
// so the fleet carries its own implementation, which is also the only version that can expose QNFO's real operations.
//
// HOW. Three pieces, all same-origin, all served by the worker that already answers the page:
//   1. GET /.webmcp/bridge.js   the browser-side module: finds document.modelContext, reads the manifest, registers
//                               every tool, and returns without registering anything when the browser has no WebMCP.
//   2. GET /.webmcp/packs.json  the machine-readable manifest (also readable by a non-browser agent).
//   3. an HTMLRewriter step on 200 HTML responses appending one <script type="module" src="/.webmcp/bridge.js">.
//
// WHY same-origin only. The bridge runs in the visitor's page with the visitor's session. A tool that reached another
// origin would hand this origin's tools to a page we do not own, and a proxy that took a caller-supplied absolute URL
// would be an SSRF surface on every page of every host. Every request template below is a path, resolved against the
// page's own origin, and read_page refuses anything that is not a path on this origin.
//
// WHY this is not a false capability claim (DECLARED-NOT-WORKING-1). The manifest is generated from the same table the
// bridge registers from, and every endpoint in it was answered 200 by a live probe on 2026-10-25 before shipping. The
// bridge reports what actually happened in window.__webmcp: supported=false when the browser has no modelContext, and
// registered=<n> only after registerTool() returned. Measured 2026-10-25 before this shipped: ideas /api/proposals
// answered 503 and was REMOVED from the manifest rather than advertised; ideas /api/sessions, q08 /api/metrics and
// POST ask.qwav.tech/api/ask answered 200. scripts/webmcp-verify.mjs re-probes every host and every tool endpoint.
//
// ROLLBACK. Revert the deploy of a worker to its previous version; the block is inert code for a browser without
// modelContext and cannot change a page's rendered output for any other client.
