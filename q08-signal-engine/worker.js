/**
 * q08-signal-engine \u2014 v0.7.0
 *
 * What it is
 *   The external signal engine for q08.org. Scrapes high-friction technical
 *   discussions from Hacker News, ranks them by a volatility score, extracts
 *   the structural friction point, then composes a long-form analytical essay
 *   and publishes it to q08.org.
 *
 * Architecture
 *   cron (every 2h) -> scrape_hn -> volatility_rank -> pick_top ->
 *   extract_friction -> build_prompt -> compose (Workers AI) ->
 *   gate (long-form prose: no bullets / no tables / no names / no handles) ->
 *   persist (D1 q08-signal) -> serve HTML
 *
 * Register (Q08-LEDE-1, owner 2026-10-13: inverted pyramid)
 *   News first, then the system: the first paragraph reports the story (who did
 *   what, where it appeared, why it matters) for a reader who missed it; the
 *   essay then explains the mechanism behind it in plain explanatory prose, with
 *   no management-consulting abstractions. Structures vary per piece; section
 *   skeletons of recent pieces are injected as banned patterns. Each draft must
 *   carry a 'worth your time' self-verdict that gates publication, and readers
 *   vote yes/flat/no, which ranks the few-shot pool. NO bullet lists. NO tables.

/* 0.40.5 Q08-FINAL-READ-RETRY-1 (#99929, pillar reach; patch): a missing strict final-reader verdict gets one fresh-cache retry; publication remains fail-closed if the retry has no verdict. FACTS and reader thresholds are unchanged. */
/* 0.40.0 Q08-FORECAST-LEDGER-1 (2026-10-30, agent_issues 1000512, pillar reach; minor: a data product it did not have, default off): with ops_config q08_forecast_ledger = on, generateForecast adds a research ledger of verbatim sentences (researchLedger: four evidence APIs queried with at most 6 capitalised names, the public https pages they link, at most 10 documents of 40000 characters, 60 lines "[R<n>] <sentence> (<host>, <date>)") to the forecast prompt and to fcGround; a fact may be cited by its tag, stripLedgerTags removes [R<n>] like [S<n>], the ledger is stored in q08_forecasts.ground_json and its sources join sources_json, and groundForPublished appends it for the re-audit. Off (absent or any other value) makes no request and leaves the prompt and ground unchanged. Replaces the unused forecastLedger draft. forecast-ledger.test.mjs. */
/* 0.39.2 BP26-AI-GATEWAY-BUDGETS-1 (2026-10-28, agent_issues 1000614 and 1000351, pillar cost): compose, title repair, forecast repair, fact-check and forecast-judge calls go through aiGatewayRun (AI Gateway with loop metadata, per-loop budget fallback), not env.AI.run directly; none of them is cached. */
/* 0.39.1 (2026-10-28, issue 5129): the VERSION line is short again (VERSION-LINE-NOTES-1); the 0.39.0 note moved here unchanged. 0.39.0 BP26-CORRECTIONS-FEED-1 (2026-10-28, agent_issues 1000334, pillar research): /api/retractions and the new /corrections and /api/corrections carry a COPE type and the original link per entry. */
/* 0.38.0 BP26-FORECAST-HYGIENE-1 (2026-10-28, charter pillar research, agent_issues 1000337; minor): a forecast resolution must name the source that settles it, the date it is read by and an edge-case rule (gate + both prompts); q08_forecast_updates holds probability updates as append-only rows; a trigger refuses in-place change of a published forecast's claim, probability, horizon, resolution and timestamp; log score beside Brier; /forecasts/calibration and /api/forecasts/calibration. */
/* 0.37.5 (2026-10-26, charter pillar reach, agent_issues 100439, 100607): Q08-THIN-PASSED-OVER-1 marks a candidate that was measured thin and passed over for a richer one, so a paper without an HTML rendering no longer holds the arXiv lane for a day (the lane ran at 02:02 and 03:04 on 2026-10-26 and then not for 16 hours); the 24-hour retry window is the existing one. */
/* 0.37.4 (2026-10-26, charter pillar reach, agent_issues 100607, 100439): Q08-GATE-GROUND-BLIND-1 removes the two checks of the writer gate that refused every comma-grouped dollar amount and every score, rating, ratio or reputation of 0.85 as fabricated without reading the source; the grounding check that runs on every draft before any panel call and on the final text already refuses a figure the source does not hold. */
/* 0.37.3 (2026-10-26, charter pillar reach, agent_issues 100607): Q08-DOTTED-NAMES-1 stops the grounding check refusing a dotted name (Qwen3.8-27B, PLAN.md, Node.js) or a possessive plural that stands in the source; the ground word set only gains words, so nothing accepted before is refused. */
/* 0.37.2 (2026-10-26, charter pillar reach, agent_issues 100439, 100453): Q08-ARXIV-POOL-1 reads the newest arXiv submissions from ops_config q08_arxiv_pool (30 to 200, absent = 100; was a fixed 30) because an arXiv run publishes about 5 times as often as a Hacker News run, and removes the never-called structuralPreflight. */
/* 0.37.0 BP26-AI-LABEL-1 (2026-10-26, charter pillar reach; EU AI Act Art. 50(4), applicable since 2026-08-02): every piece page carries a visible "AI-generated" label linked to the published method note and JSON-LD creditText; HTML responses add nosniff, HSTS (no includeSubDomains) and X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN. */

/* 0.36.0 PUBLICATION-GATE-AUDIT-2 (2026-10-26, pillar reach; minor: a new data product, q08_retraction_rate_30d, and a writer-order switch). Evidence: engine_runs, 14 days to 2026-10-26: 20 ok of 537 finished runs (3.7%), 517 gate failures, about 48 attempts and 0.5 published pieces a day, the daily neuron pace reached on 8 to 17 runs a day since 2026-10-21. (1) Q08-WRITER-ORDER-2: nemotron, gpt-oss, kimi, by end-to-end yield (10.2%, 1.7%, 0.9%), not by the writer-gate pass rate; ops_config q08_compose_order overrides. (2) Q08-LEDGER-TAG-FORMS-2: ledger citations in round, curly, fullwidth and lenticular brackets, with "&" or "/" between numbers, after a dagger, or as [ledger S3] are removed before any check (the cause of 38 accuracy failures that listed ledger numbers as figures and tags as names). (3) Q08-REVIEWER-HYGIENE-1: a reviewer's object printed as a string is unwrapped, an item with no claim text is set aside (a fail that names nothing else still fails closed), an item whose closing clause says it is supported is acquitted. (4) Q08-PRECHECK-CONTEXT-1: each flagged item carries 24 characters of context on the stage row. (5) Q08-RETRACTION-METRIC-1: q08_retraction_rate_30d. No gate was loosened: names, figures, years, the lede check, the reader panel, the two-family fact-check and the prune are unchanged. */
/* 0.35.1 Q08-RETRY-PROGRESS-1: a repair that returns exactly a draft already rejected in the same verifyAndRevise invocation stops as an accuracy failure before spending another verification. Changed drafts still receive the full verification; no claim-count heuristic, quality threshold, reviewer family, retry ceiling or spend control changes. Run 955 spent 16 fact-check calls on multiple repairs; its log does not retain draft text, so savings on that run are not claimed. */
/* 0.35.0 Q08-RUN-STAGE-ATTRIBUTION-1: engine_runs now records reader-panel and fact-check calls separately while preserving verify_calls as their total. The q08.org/api/runs?limit=60 evidence sample returned 20 rows (IDs 952 through 933), not 60; 13 were gate_failed and 7 deferred. No quality gate, spend policy, or generation behavior changed. */
/* 0.34.4 Q08-LEDGER-WHITESPACE-GROUPS-1: the grounding normalizer now removes grouped source-ledger citations such as [S2 S3] and [S1, S2 S3] before any gate reads the draft. The factual and reader-quality gates are unchanged. */
/* 0.34.5 Q08-WRITER-YIELD-1 (2026-10-25): live 30-day q08_reader_tests showed writer-gate pass rates of 66.1% for gpt-oss (342 attempts), 60.2% for kimi (108), and 21.2% for nemotron (472), while the old order led with nemotron. Put the highest-yield, lowest-neuron writer first; the uncapped fallback favors yield, while the capped fallback favors the lower-cost nemotron. Quality thresholds are unchanged; revert by restoring the prior writer arrays. */
// 0.33.0 COST-SUSTAIN-2 (2026-10-21, owner directive: research and publication <= USD 300/month all-in, quality must not drop; pillar cost): a hard daily neuron budget for q08 (ops_config q08_daily_neurons, default 150000 = USD 1.65/day at USD 0.011/1k; measured 135-288k/day on 10-14..10-20) paced over the UTC day (spent <= budget x (hour+1)/24 + 10% burst) gates generate() and auditPublished(): over the pace the tick writes a deferred engine_runs row and waits, nothing is skipped and no gate, reader panel or fact check changes. Root cause it closes: q08 had a publish cap and an attempt cap but no spend bound, so retries and stall retries could spend without limit. GET /budget.
/* 0.32.0 Q08-FACT-LEDGER-1 (2026-10-19, agent_issues 2606 Q08-PUBLISH-STALL-AUTO-1, pillar research; minor: the engine now decides a deterministic source-grounding stage on its own ahead of the reader panel). Evidence (q08.org/api/runs, runs 647-666, 12:03Z to 21:30Z on 2026-10-19; stall digest of the last 24 h: fact-check 28, reader panel 12, writer gate 4): no piece since 2026-10-18T20:15Z, 15 of the last 20 runs ended gate_failed (the runs that logged their calls, 655-661, used 3 to 8 writer calls and 5 to 16 reviewer calls each) and the other five idled on the daily attempt cap (40/40). Cause: the reader panel and its editor rounds ran first and the source-grounding check last, so a draft whose names, years or figures are not in the source material was read by up to six judges and rewritten by an editor before the check that would have refused it, and the writer was never shown which sentences of the source it could rely on. Change 1, groundPreCheck: after the writer gate and before runLevels (essay path) and before runLevels in generateForecast, the free deterministic check groundingProblems runs on the draft against the same ground the fact-check later reads (labelledGround is now built before the panel; the forecast ground is built before it too). On problems the essay gets one pruneUnsupported pass held to the same gate as a repair round (prunedGateProblems and ledeProblems) and a re-check; a draft that is clean after it goes on to the panel, one that is not ends the run with gateResult 'accuracy: ...' (stallStage still reads fact-check) and no panel call; a forecast is not pruned and ends the same way. A q08_reader_tests row (round 0, role ground_precheck) records the outcome whenever the check finds a problem. The stage is fail-safe: if it throws, the error is logged and the draft goes to the panel exactly as before. Change 2, sourceLedger in buildPrompt: the sentences of the item description, the signal and the linked article are numbered [S1], [S2] ... in a SOURCE LEDGER block after the background, with the rule that every real-world assertion in the reporting sections reuses the names, figures, dates and attributions of one ledger sentence and that the analysis section stays exempt (Q08-FACT-INFERENCE-1); normalizeDraftCore removes a ledger tag the writer copies into its text. Unchanged: the FACTS rule text of Q08_DIRECTIVE, the fabrication checks, factCheck, verifyAndRevise, PUBLISH_MIN_CHARS, the panel and final-read thresholds, COMPOSE_MODELS and the attempt cap. Not claimed: that this restores publishing. Expected on the first full UTC day after the deploy: runs ending 'accuracy' on a name, year or figure fall to the pre-check (cheap, no panel call), compose_calls and verify_calls per gate_failed run fall, and the unsupported-claim items the two-family fact-check lists for paraphrase (not a name, year or figure) are what the ledger is meant to reduce; the measure is the share of engine_runs ending 'fact-check' and q08_gate_pass_rate_7d. Review repair in the same release (before it shipped): (1) stripLedgerTags now removes a grouped or ranged tag as well as the single one ([S1, S2], [S3;S4], [S2-S3] with a hyphen, en dash or em dash, and the two-digit [S12] of a ledger past nine lines); a model cites numbered sources in groups, and such a tag left in the draft read as a name the source does not hold ("S1"), so a tag in the lede made groundPreCheck refuse the whole draft over a cosmetic tag; the parenthesised "(S3)" is not stripped (it is not flagged, and it is how real text writes Amazon S3). (2) ops_config q08_ground_precheck = on (default) | prune | off is the pre-check's off switch and its tested alternate path, read like q08_panel_order (cached five minutes, a failing read keeps the last known mode, an unset or unknown value is on): prune keeps the essay prune but passes the draft to the panel unchanged when the prune cannot clear the problems and never refuses a forecast; off makes no pre-check call and restores the 0.31.3 flow (verifyAndRevise prunes an essay and sends one model revision for an essay or a forecast after the panel). What the refusal costs where that model revision used to run is NOT measured: ok rows keep no repair trail, so it is unknown how many of the 17 ok runs of the seven days to 2026-10-19 passed through the revision, and the 25 gate_failed runs of those days that ended on a name, year or figure all ran before this stage existed. (3) migrations/2026-10-19-q08-fact-ledger.sql registers the gate (control_registry q08-ground-precheck), the failure mode q08-factcheck-late-failure with its detector contract fm-q08-factcheck-late-failure, the capability and the decision. New release notes go in this block, never on the VERSION line (VERSION-LINE-NOTES-1, 2026-10-19). */
// Release notes of 0.31.3 and earlier, moved unchanged off the VERSION line (they rode on it as a 36,000-character comment): 0.31.1 Q08-PANEL-CALIBRATION-1 (2026-10-19, pillar research; patch): the reader panel rotates over the whole pool again (the 0.31.0 order put the two strictest judges, kimi-k2.6 pass 0.35 and deepseek-v4-flash pass 0.263 in q08_reader_tests, in every round-1 panel and cut the chance a draft clears it); ops_config q08_panel_order = measured restores the 0.31.0 order. 0.31.0 Q08-YIELD-1 (agent_issues 99929, 99930 and 2606, 2026-10-19; pillar research, cost second): 266 of 311 runs in 7 days ended gate_failed (17 ok, pass rate 0.06) at 83,598 neurons per published piece, and a run recorded neither how much source material it read nor how many model calls it spent. Every engine_runs row now carries source_chars, source_kind, compose_calls and verify_calls (nullable columns added by the worker's own schema bootstrap); the thin-source test is no longer a flat 600 characters of article but the thinnest source that has published in the last 30 days, once five logged ok runs exist (a source below it ends the run as skipped and is retried after 24 hours with another candidate ahead of it); and a repair that already pruned flagged claims, is pruned again to a draft under the 2800-character floor and flags the same claim classes stops there instead of spending a model revision to extend it. PUBLISH_MIN_CHARS, the FACTS rule and every fact-check threshold are unchanged. Q08-REVIEWER-SWAP-1 (same release, agent_issues 2606 and 100118): qwen3.8-27b (104 of 134 calls errored, 80 s) and glm-5.3-flash (175 of 400, 58 s) led both reviewer lists after MODEL-FLOOR-1 removed the judges that answered; kimi-k2.6 and deepseek-v4-flash-0731 now lead the reader panel and deepseek-v4-flash-0731, gpt-oss-20b (the cheaper small judge, 462 neurons a verdict pair against about 696 for the old order and 972 for flash plus kimi: no Workers AI spend added) and kimi-k2.6 lead the fact-check, the previous reviewers stay in both pools as the per-request fallback, and reviewerHealth orders any reviewer with 30% errors on 12 or more calls over two days (ai_call_counters) behind the others, so the previous order returns by itself if the new head fails; no banned model is used and no family leaves a pool. // 0.30.0 CRON-GRID-1 (0.29.0 was claimed by the Q08-YIELD-1 handoff patch, which lands as 0.31.0) (owner directive 2026-10-19, pillar autonomy): the daily 17:00 digest trigger is gone; it runs on the hourly :00 fire after its slot, and every fire is logged to cron_fire_log for CRON-WATCH-1. // 0.28.14 SIGNAL-SQL-ARITY-1 (#2779, 2026-10-19, RESOLVE-ALL-OPEN-1): stallDetector bound one value to "UPDATE issue_triage SET close_evidence=?1 WHERE issue_id=?2", the one prepare/bind site in this file whose placeholder count differs from its binds (static scan of 150 sites); it now binds the issue id and upserts the triage row, so a recovered stall closes its Q08-PUBLISH-STALL-AUTO-1 issue. // Q08-YIELD-ORDER-1 (2026-10-18, pillar research). Measured 7-day publish yield from engine_runs: nemotron 12.8%, gpt-oss 3.8%, kimi 1.7%. COMPOSE_MODELS led with kimi (lowest yield, highest cost, ~1040 neurons/call); reordered to nemotron, gpt-oss, kimi. Raises q08_gate_pass_rate_7d and lowers q08_neurons_per_published_piece_7d together. 0.28.1 Q08-PRUNE-EXTEND-1 (agent_issues 2284; 29 of 77 failed runs in the 48 h to 2026-10-14 13:30 UTC ended "too short after pruning"): when deleting the flagged sentences leaves a clean draft whose only problem is the 2800-character floor, the one model revision extends that pruned draft from the source (every surviving sentence kept, the deleted claims named as not to be restated) instead of rewriting the unpruned draft, and the result is re-verified in full. 0.28.0 EXTERNAL-PROPERTIES-1 (owner 2026-10-14: '"By property" SHALL ALSO INCLUDE Q08.ORG AND READING.Q08.ORG'): every tick ends by mirroring the finished runs of the last 7 days (published or rejected at the gate, title and stage only) into qnfo-audit.content_external_items, so fleet.qnfo.org/content shows q08.org by property. 0.27.0 (owner 2026-10-14: "REJECTION RATES ARE UNACCEPTABLY HIGH ... WHY ZERO PUBLISHED TODAY?"; engine_runs 394-417: 2 of 24 published, 13 of 16 failed essays stopped on a flagged lede claim): Q08-LEDE-PRUNE-2 (a flagged lede sentence is cut when another lede sentence remains; ledeProblems still guards the opening) and Q08-GROUND-PROVENANCE-1 (the fact-check ground states the item's title and the site it appeared on as sentences, and the reviewers are told the source line is source material; "the paper appears on arxiv.org" was flagged unsupported in runs 415 and 417). 0.26.1 Q08-TITLE-REPAIR-2: every attempted title repair leaves a q08_reader_tests trail note (the reply opening or the error; runs 405 and 406 left none), and a title wrapped in a preamble, a Title: label or a code fence is read. 0.26.0 Q08-TITLE-REPAIR-1 (agent_issues 2284, 2503): a writer draft whose only writer-gate problems are its title gets one short title call to the same writer before the next writer is tried (8 of 15 nemotron drafts in a day were refused for the title alone while nemotron wrote every published piece). // 0.25.1 WORKERS-BP-LOGGING-1 (#2342): swallowed catches log; Q08-PANEL-METRIC-STATE-1 (#1895): the panel effective-votes and panel-unavailable writes set state MEASURED. // 0.25.0 Q08-ENTITY-BACKGROUND-1: the products, projects and organisations a headline names get their own full Wikipedia article in the background, so the system the analysis explains is in the checked source (run 390). 0.24.2 was: // 0.24.2 Q08-PRUNE-BODY-FLOOR-1 + Q08-SOURCE-CONCESSION-1: the prune floor is the publish floor measured on the body, and a fact-check item whose reason concedes it is in the source material (FAQ, comments, background) is dropped (run 388). 0.24.1 was: // 0.24.1 Q08-PARAPHRASE-ITEMS-1: in the reporting, a fact-check item whose reason concedes the content (phrasing, not explicitly stated, implied) and whose sentence has no digit, quotation or name does not fail the essay (run 387). 0.24.0 was: // 0.24.0 Q08-BUDGET-ROUTE-1: while the workers-ai or total ai_spend cap is breached the writer order puts nemotron and gpt-oss before kimi-k2.6 (BUDGET-SOFT-ROUTE-1, issue 1780). 0.23.2 was: // 0.23.2 CRON-ONLY-HEARTBEAT-1 (agent_issues 2397, pillar autonomy): each hourly scheduled run ends with a qnfo-audit fleet_heartbeat upsert (ok=0 when generation threw); write errors are logged. // 0.23.1 Q08-NAME-COMPOUND-1 + Q08-COMPOSE-TRAIL-1 (each writer's gate result is kept in q08_reader_tests): in a hyphenated compound only the capitalised parts are checked as names ("AI-driven", "Claude-generated"; run 386). 0.23.0 0.23.0 Q08-TECH-SYSTEMS-1: the analysis explains the technical system (components, data flow, the design decision or constraint behind the event, the trade-off) instead of an incentive template; the background reads full Wikipedia articles on the technologies; both reader prompts judge technical understanding. 0.22.1 0.22.1 Q08-PRUNE-FLOOR-2: the prune floor is the publish floor (3000 characters with title and verdict), so the repair stops instead of eroding a draft that can no longer publish (run 385). 0.22.0 0.22.0 Q08-WRITER-UPGRADE-1: kimi-k2.6 writes first with thinking off, nemotron and gpt-oss as per-request fallback. 0.21.0 0.21.0 Q08-FINAL-READ-1 + Q08-SOURCE-DEPTH-1 (eight comments and arXiv abstracts up to 3000 characters; the fact-checkers count background and comments as source): the exact text that would be published needs 2800 characters of body and a final two-family reader panel (vacuity-focused prompt, mean 4, no judge under 3, fails closed) after the fact check and its prunes. 0.20.3 0.20.3 Q08-ANALYSIS-CONCRETE-1: an analysis-check item counts only when the sentence it quotes has a digit, a quotation or a name; abstract reasoning flagged against the reviewers' own instruction is dropped (run 383). 0.20.2 0.20.2 Q08-VERDICT-NORM-1: near-miss verdict lines are normalised, and a first draft whose only problem is the verdict line gets the verdict micro-call (which now reads the essay) before a full rewrite (run 382). 0.20.1 0.20.1 Q08-MARK-SHIFT-1: an analysis marker placed where the guard rails refuse it moves later, paragraph by paragraph, to the first accepted place instead of sending the whole essay to the strict check (run 381). 0.20.0 0.20.0 Q08-ANALYSIS-DEPTH-1: an essay publishes only with a systems analysis of at least two paragraphs and 700 characters whose opening refers to something the piece said (a thin one goes to the one model revision); the inference prune keeps the analysis section (Q08-ANALYSIS-KEEP-1), and a "This <noun>" sentence left after a cut goes with it (Q08-DANGLING-CUT-1). 0.19.3 0.19.3 Q08-SOURCE-ORDER-1: Hacker News stories and arXiv papers are tried before GitHub repositories (alternating, never the last source twice); a repository is used only when no story or paper ahead of it has enough source material (runs 354, 356, 358, 375, 379: repository essays had no system to analyse). // 0.19.2 Q08-ANALYSIS-AUTO-1 (run 378): when the writer leaves the <!-- analysis --> marker out, the analysis starts at the first body paragraph after the lede and context written in reasoning language (same 60% and 600-character guard rails, still checked for invented facts); the run error records the analysis split (marked, auto, none). // 0.19.1 Q08-SOURCE-GROUND-1 (run 377): the fact-check ground carries the source description the writer is given (kind, title, link, site) and labels each part (discussion comments, linked article, background), so "posted on apple.com" and "a commenter on Hacker News said" can be verified instead of failing as not in source. // 0.19.0 Q08-ANALYSIS-SECTION-1 (owner 2026-10-13: big-picture systems analysis): the writer marks where its systems analysis starts with an invisible <!-- analysis --> line; the reporting before it keeps the sentence-by-sentence fact-check, the analysis after it is checked only for concrete invented facts (events, named parties acting, dates, numbers, quotations, studies), the deterministic name/year/figure check still covers the whole text, the analysis may be at most 60% of the body, and the marker never reaches readers or the published page. // 0.18.2 (run 375): "README", "CHANGELOG", "GitHub" and "repository" are not names the grounding check needs in the source (the source of a repository piece is its README); the fact revision is told to keep a news lede naming the subject and where it appeared. // 0.18.1 Q08-LEDE-PRUNE-1: the fact-check prune never deletes sentences of the first paragraph (a piece was published opening "Users therefore trust ..." after its lede was pruned); a flagged claim in the lede sends the draft to the model revision, and every pruned draft is re-checked with ledeProblems. // 0.18.0 Q08-CONTEXT-1 (owner 2026-10-13: "totally lacking in context and big-picture systems analysis"): each essay gets a BACKGROUND pack of verified reference text (Wikipedia lead sections for the story's subject and recent news coverage) that the writer may cite and the fact-check verifies against; the directive requires a context section and a systems analysis (parties, incentives, constraints, feedback loop, who gains and who pays, where else it operates); the fact-check treats framed analysis that adds no new name, number or event as not a violation, and a reviewer reason calling an item analysis marks it reasoning; readers cap a piece that only retells its source at 3. // 0.17.6 Q08-PRUNE-VERDICT-1 (run 369): the sentence prune sets the verdict line aside and puts it back unchanged, so a verdict that shared a paragraph with the last sentence is no longer damaged into a "missing verdict" failure. // 0.17.5 Q08-LEDE-SPLIT-1 (run 368): an overlong first paragraph is split at a sentence boundary into a lede of at most 70 words and a following paragraph, instead of failing "lede too long"; nothing is added or removed. // 0.17.4 Q08-TICK-BUDGET-1 (agent_issues 2479): an essay after a failed forecast waits for the next tick when more than 240 s are used (run 366 left no row: forecast 256 s + essay up to 644 s reached the 15-minute limit), repair rounds stop at a tick deadline, and every early exit of generate() writes an engine_runs row (skipped or deferred) instead of vanishing. // 0.17.3 Q08-LEDE-1 (fleet audit 2026-10-13): forecasts open with a news lede too (the case they start from, where it was reported, the forecast and its probability) and are checked by ledeProblems; the forecast register is plain explanatory journalism, not the earlier detached register; the site description and home page say what q08 is in plain words. // 0.17.2 PUBLISH-STALL-DIGEST-1 (fleet audit 2026-10-13): the stall issue is rewritten on every stalled tick with the hours, a 24 h breakdown of the stage each run ended at and the newest errors, and turns critical after 24 h; stall failures are logged instead of swallowed. // 0.17.1 Q08-FULLTEXT-1 (agent_issues 2470): the richest thin candidate is written from only when its full text was fetched (at least 600 characters); an abstract-only candidate is skipped with a reported reason. // 0.17.0 Q08-LEDE-1 (owner 2026-10-13): inverted-pyramid essays. The writer is told the source (kind, title, link) and must open with a news lede (who did what, where it appeared, when, why it matters) before the analysis; a deterministic lede check (names the subject, no abstract opening, at most 90 words) joins the writer gate; the editor keeps the lede and reader cuts never remove it; readers score the opening first; titles are plain headlines naming the subject. // 0.16.0 Q08-GITHUB-README-1 (run 358): a GitHub repository source is read from its raw README (the page fetch returned a 378-byte stub, so true README statements were refused as unsupported), falling back to the page when there is none. // 0.15.2 Q08-PARAPHRASE-2 (run 357): a FACT-labelled item whose reason only objects to the wording ("slightly different wording") is a paraphrase too; 0.14.8 read that reason only on unlabelled items. // 0.15.1 Q08-REVISION-FLOOR-1 (run 356): the fact revision is held to the 1500-character prune floor, not the 2800-character writing floor (it rewrites an already pruned or edited draft), so a phrase-level tell is repaired instead of failing with "too short". // 0.15.0 Q08-READER-CUTS-1 (runs 339-355): the paragraph cuts the readers name ("delete paragraphs 4, 6 and 7", "cut the last two paragraphs") are applied deterministically before the model editor, at most half the body and only when the result passes the editor gate; the model editor is the fallback. // 0.14.11 Q08-FLOOR-PARAS-1 (run 354): a pruned or edited draft held to its lower floor needs 4 substantial paragraphs, not the 6 of a full 2800-character draft. // 0.14.10 Q08-PRUNE-FUZZY-1 (run 353): an unsupported item the reviewer paraphrased instead of quoting removes the one sentence sharing most of its content words (at least 4 and 60%), instead of "prune located nothing". // 0.14.9 Q08-TITLE-CARRY-2 (run 352): the title carry (editor drafts and the fact revision) uses every title rule of the gate (label, formula and Title Case titles), not only the dry-title pattern and the length limit. // 0.14.8 Q08-PRUNE-ROUNDS-2 + Q08-PARAPHRASE-1 (run 350): fact repair runs up to 8 rounds while it has used under 6 minutes (5 before), and a reviewer reason that only objects to the wording ("not in source as a direct quote", "not verbatim") marks a paraphrase, not a FACT; "not entirely in source" is read as a negation (it was read as support since 0.14.2). // 0.14.7 Q08-FACT-REVISION-FORMAT-1 (run 349): the fact revision keeps the draft's passing title and verdict line and gets the deterministic framing repair on a phrase-level-only gate failure, instead of failing on a label title it wrote. // 0.14.6 Q08-FACT-SHAPE-2 (runs 347-348): a reviewer item labelled FACT whose quoted text has no digit, quotation or capitalised name and uses generalising wording (wherever, any, every, if, therefore, would, could, pattern, mechanism, incentive) is reasoning; a plain modal claim stays a FACT. // 0.14.5 also removes the title checks 0.14.4-codeagent (PR 1061) pasted ahead of the gate's own if/else chain, which reported every failing title twice. // 0.14.5 Q08-HANDLE-STRIP-1 (run 346): a social handle the writer copied from the source loses its '@' instead of failing the gate (e-mail addresses and @cf/ model ids untouched). Q08-EDITOR-TITLE-CARRY-1 (run 343): an editor draft whose title is missing, over 100 characters or a label title keeps the writer's passing title instead of failing the gate; the body stays the editor's. // 0.14.3 Q08-EDITOR-ROUND-2 + Q08-FACT-OBJECT-ITEM-1 + Q08-FACT-SHAPE-1 (runs 338-341): an unlabelled fact-check item whose quoted text has no digit, quotation or capitalised name and uses causal or modal wording, with a reason that quotes nothing and names no date, figure or name, is reasoning (deleted when the draft can spare it, never a failure); a close panel miss (mean at least 3 of 5) after the editor gets one more editor pass that applies the readers' named cuts, read by a third panel; a fact-check item returned as an object is rebuilt as "LABEL: claim -- reason" instead of "[object Object]". // 0.14.2 Q08-FACT-INFERENCE-2 (run 338): reviewers skipped the FACT/INFERENCE label and wrote 'inference from source' in the reason; an unlabelled item whose reason names an inference, interpretation, generalisation, assumption or paraphrase (and no name, date, number or quotation) is an INFERENCE; the prompt shows an example answer. // 0.14.1 Q08-EDITOR-VERDICT-CARRY-1 (run 337): an editor draft that dropped the final 'worth your time' line gets the writer's line back instead of failing the gate. // 0.14.0 Q08-STALL-RETRY-1 (agent_issues 2286): while no piece has been published for 2 hours, the :30 cron makes a second generation attempt after its audit (same gates and caps, never overlapping the :00 attempt; ops_config q08_stall_retry = off stops it). // 0.13.2 Q08-FACT-INFERENCE-1 (agent_issues 2286): the fact-check labels each finding FACT or INFERENCE; only FACT findings fail a draft (unlabelled ones count as FACT), INFERENCE findings are deleted when the draft can spare them; runs 333-335 failed only because reviewers listed the essay's own reasoning next to real fact errors. // 0.13.0 FRAMING-REPAIR-1 + FACTCHECK-DEGRADE-1 (agent_issues 2284, 2286, 2288; pillar reach): a gate failure made only of phrase-level tells is repaired without a model call (the flagged sentences removed, full gate re-run, at most a quarter of the sentences; logged as framing_repair rows and in the run error), the writer, editor and forecaster prompts carry one line naming the framing idioms the gate rejects, the retry feedback shows each flagged phrase in its sentence, and the fact-check panel tries every non-writer family on Workers AI (the writer families join the pool, cheaper sibling first) before a draft fails as unavailable. // 0.12.0 Q08-EDGE-CACHE-1 (issue 2343, pillar reach): plain GET pages are served from the edge cache for their public max-age=300 (TTFB 0.8-1.6 s measured: every view rendered from D1); a cache hit on a piece page still counts both reads; every HTML response carries Referrer-Policy and Permissions-Policy. // 0.11.19 Q08-READER-NOTHINK-1 (issue 2085): reader judges use the measured per-model reasoning switches and a 6000-token budget (2000 left reasoning judges without a verdict on 11 panel reads in 3 days). // 0.11.18 Q08-EDIT-FLOOR-1: the editor pass applies the readers' cuts and is held to 1800 characters, not the 2800-character writing floor (runs 319, 323, 327: readers asked to delete restating paragraphs, the editor was told to keep 2800 characters, the second panel rejected the same padding); forecasts keep the writing floor. // 0.11.17 Q08-PRUNE-FLOOR-1: a draft repaired by deleting the reviewers' quoted sentences is held to a 1500-character floor (the audit-repair floor), not the 2800-character writing floor, so the repair stops falling back to a model revision that writes new unsupported detail (runs 292-332: no piece since 2026-10-10 06:05); five prune rounds, one model revision at most, and the repair trail is kept in the run error. // 0.11.16 SINGLE-LETTER-1: a single capital letter (the O of O(n), a variable, a list label) is never read as a name by the grounding check (run 330: accuracy "name not in the source: O"). // 0.11.15 Q08-FACT-REPAIR-1 + FACTCHECK-NOTHINK-1 (issue 2349) + Q08-VERDICT-TOLERANT-1: reviewers run with reasoning off where a measured switch exists (0.7-2.6 s instead of 4-9 s), 75 s timeout, and a verdict is read from the explicit fields when the JSON is wrapped or truncated. // 0.11.13 Q08-PRUNE-1: a draft that fails the fact-check is first repaired by deleting exactly the sentences the reviewers quoted (deletion cannot add a fact; runs 319-326 show every model revision reintroducing unsupported detail), then re-verified in full, up to three rounds; a model revision is only the fallback. // 0.11.12 Q08-EDITOR-PHRASE-REVISE-1: an editor draft rejected only for phrase-level tells (a label title) gets one targeted revision instead of failing the run. 0.11.11 0.11.11 GROUND-HYPHEN-1: the name check treats unicode hyphens as "-" and a hyphenated source name grants its parts, and the capital/cost/policy-driven label-title pattern no longer rejects sentence-case titles (run 318: 'Capital-driven polishing eclipses the original creator'). // 0.11.8 Q08-GENERAL-CLAIMS-1: the writer states general mechanisms only as conditional reasoning from the source (run 315: "many programs assume", "the only reliable safeguard" were flagged as unsupported prevalence claims), and the reviewers do not count conditionals or mentions of the source as violations. // 0.11.7 Q08-FACTCHECK-POOL-1: fact-check reviewers run in a fixed order, llama-3.3-70b and qwen3-30b first, because the rotating pool led with models that timed out or exhausted their token budget (runs 305-314 ended fact-check unavailable). // 0.11.6 Q08-RICH-SOURCE-1: candidates are chosen for source richness (story, discussion and fetched article of at least 2200 characters, arXiv papers read from their HTML rendering) before writing starts, because the fact-check rejected every draft a thin source forced the writer to invent (run 314: unsupported claims about a story whose article could not be fetched); the richest candidate is used when none reaches the bar. // 0.11.5 Q08-PANEL-THRESHOLD-1: the reader panel passes at a mean of 3.5 with at least half the readers reading to the end (was 4 from both: readers splitting 3 and 4 rejected every source-only draft); the name check skips all-caps acronyms of up to five letters (the two-family fact-check still reviews them) and sentence-opening prepositions. // 0.11.4 Q08-AI-OBJECT-REPLY-1: Workers AI returns `response` as a parsed object when a model replies with bare JSON (llama, qwen), which became "[object Object]" and no verdict (run 312: three of five fact-check reviewers); every reply is now normalised to text before it is parsed. // 0.11.3 Q08-EDITOR-GROUNDED-1: the editor pass said "cut anything that only restates" with a 2800-character floor and "replace abstractions with people doing things", so thin-source drafts came back too short or invented concrete detail; the editor now adds nothing outside the draft and source and keeps the floor, the reader prompts ask for cuts never outside facts, the length label is 450-1100 words (700 words could never fit the 2800-character floor), and the editor-gate failure names its gate problems. // 0.11.2 Q08-FACTCHECK-DIAG-1: fact-check reviewers run one at a time over every non-writer family and a failure keeps its cause in the run error (the verdict outage had no visible reason). // 0.11.1 Q08-FACTCHECK-BUDGET-1: reviewers get 8000 tokens (2000 left reasoning models without a verdict, so every run ended "fact-check unavailable"); the name check ignores sentence connectives, compass adjectives and common technical acronyms. // 0.11.0 Q08-YIELD-REPAIR-1 (pillar: reach; owner directive 2026-10-11, automation must run user-free): generation runs hourly and audit/repair has its own :30 cron; an essay that fails the audit is repaired (unsupported claims deleted, correction note) before it is retracted and earlier audit retractions get one restoration attempt; essay length follows the source (450-1100 words, never padded) so the panel stops rejecting padding; name check ignores initials; article fetch upgrades http to https; attempt cap 4x. // 0.10.2 Q08-RENDER-1 + NO-DEAD-DOI-2 (pillar: reach; owner directives 2026-10-10, agent_issues 2279 and 2275): titles, headings, list items, claims and previews render inline Markdown (*italic*, **bold**, `code`, links) and math (\\( \\), $$ $$, and $...$ only with a TeX token and no space inside, never before a digit, so currency stays literal) through q08Inline; <title>, og/twitter, citation meta, JSON-LD, RSS, e-mail digest, social text and BibTeX/RIS use q08Plain (markers stripped, TeX as Unicode); mdToHtml gains numbered lists and block quotes; the funnel copy no longer claims a DOI;

a piece is published only when every name, year and figure is in its source material (signal plus the fetched article) and two reviewers from other model families find no unsupported claim (a reviewer outage fails closed); published pieces are re-audited each cron and a failure is retracted in public (410 notice, /retractions, out of index, feed, sitemap, APIs and social; forecasts built on it too). // 0.9.0 Q08-FORECAST-1 (pillar: reach): forecast mode. Every FORECAST_EVERY pieces the engine writes a most-likely scenario narrative from a published essay's mechanism (dated causal sequence, rival scenarios with probabilities, leading indicators, a checkable resolution condition), stored in q08_forecasts, settled by a two-family judge panel when the horizon passes and scored (Brier) on /forecasts and /api/forecasts; undecidable ones go void in public after 4 checks. // 0.8.13-codeagent 0.8.12 Q08-PHRASE-REVISE-1: a phrase-level-only gate failure is retried as a revision of the same draft, not a rewrite from scratch (#2034);

Where the source shows people or firms choosing, add who is rewarded for which choice. Abstract words are not analysis: 'the loop', 'the coupling', 'the structure', 'the dynamic', 'the information gap' must each be replaced by the concrete thing (which cookie, which queue, which check, which incentive, held by whom). Explain technical terms in a clause the first time they appear. Use BACKGROUND facts where they exist and attribute them; otherwise reason openly and say it is reasoning ('the incentive is ...', 'that means ...', 'if ... then ...'), introducing no new name, date, number or event.

A piece that only retells its source scores at most 3, and the fix names the system it should have explained. Abstract words standing in for that explanation ('the loop', 'the coupling', 'the structure') score at most 3. Then: does it open with something concrete that happened? Can you state its claim in one sentence? Does every paragraph add a new fact or step, or only restate in abstract words? Are the words plain, or do role words ('the observer', 'the actor', 'the arrangement') and announcements of structure stand in for people doing things? Does it reason from the facts it states to a general mechanism, or does it lean on a stock example? Be strict: a 4 must be earned. The writer may use only the facts of the story it was given and the reasoning that follows from them, so never ask for outside facts, history, examples, names or figures: when a paragraph is thin, the fix is to cut or merge it, and a short, dense, accurate piece that states its facts and reasons to one mechanism can earn a 4."

Say where the mechanism it describes most likely leads next, as one concrete, dated, checkable scenario, and say how likely you think it is.",
  "",
  "WHAT A FORECAST IS HERE: a most-likely scenario narrative. Of the mutually exclusive ways the next months can go, tell the single course you judge most probable, as a causal sequence in plain prose: who does what, because of what, and what that sets off, in the order it would happen, with approximate dates. Then give the strongest rival scenarios, each with its probability, and say what would let one of them overtake yours. The reader must be able to check you later.",
  "",
  "COMMITMENT: pick one main claim that a public fact can settle yes or no on or before the horizon date, and write its resolution condition so a stranger could check it without asking what you meant. A claim that cannot lose ('pressure will keep growing') is rejected. Prefer the sharpest claim you can honestly stand behind: a 40 percent forecast that names a specific event beats an 80 percent forecast that names nothing.",

They are your judgments, not measurements: do not dress them as data and do not hedge them. The main scenario must be at least as probable as each alternative, and all stated probabilities together must not exceed 100 percent; the remainder is 'something else', and say so.",
  "",
  "BASE RATE: before the scenario, identify the class of situations you are reasoning from and how that class usually goes. Use dated precedents and historical statistics only when the ESSAY, SIGNAL or RESEARCH LEDGER states them. Then explain why this case should or should not follow the class.",

  "FACTS (hard, non-negotiable, and checked): every claim about the real world as it stands today (an event, a date, a person, an organisation, a product, a law, a number, a price, a count, an identifier, a quotation) must be stated in the ESSAY, SIGNAL or RESEARCH LEDGER below, verbatim or as a direct paraphrase. Your memory is not a source: add no outside facts, precedents or statistics. Future dates and your own probabilities are the only numbers you may add. Never state a projected quantity (a price, a user count, a market size) unless the text derives it from a figure in the sources. Never invent a source, a report or a quote. Every draft is fact-checked against the essay, signal and research ledger by independent reviewers from other model families; one unsupported claim and the forecast is not published. A general honest sentence beats a specific unsupported one.",

Never mention 'the essay', 'the signal' or any pipeline field.",

// 19 s). The last FACTCHECK_TAIL_N entries are the previous reviewers, kept as the per-request fallback: they are asked only after every other
// model has been tried, so a round that used to wait out two failures before its first verdict now reaches one in a few seconds, and a draft
// still fails as "unavailable" only when all eight models failed. reviewerHealth() orders any reviewer that is erroring now behind the rest.

// ---- WEBMCP-FLEET-1:BEGIN (sourced from _shared/webmcp.js; applied by scripts/webmcp-apply.mjs; do not edit inside a worker) ----
// WEBMCP-FLEET-1 (2026-10-25, pillar reach, owner directive "implement WebMCP systemwide across the fleet").
//
// WHAT. WebMCP (https://blog.cloudflare.com/webmcp/, August 2026) is a browser standard, shipping experimentally in
// Chrome 146, that appears in the page as document.modelContext: a site registers MCP tools with registerTool() so an
// agent visiting the page can call the site's own operations instead of guessing its way through a page built for
// humans. Cloudflare's developer preview offers a zone toggle that injects a bridge and two packs (c2pa, and a proxy
// to the site's own MCP server). That toggle is Dashboard-only and this fleet's token may not write zone Snippets
// (probed 2026-10-25: HTTP 403 "snippets are not allowed", and GET /user/tokens 403 so no wider token can be minted),
// so the fleet carries its own implementation, which is also the only version that can expose QNFO's real operations.
//
// HOW. Three pieces, all same-origin, all served by the worker that already answers the page:
//   1. GET /.webmcp/bridge.js   the browser-side module: finds document.modelContext, reads the manifest, registers
//                               every tool, and returns without registering anything when the browser has no WebMCP.
//   2. GET /.webmcp/packs.json  the machine-readable manifest (also readable by a non-browser agent).
//   3. an HTMLRewriter step on 200 HTML responses appending one <script type="module" src="/.webmcp/bridge.js">.
//
// WHY same-origin only. The bridge runs in the visitor's page with the visitor's session. A tool that reached another
// origin would hand this origin's tools to a page we do not own, and a proxy that took a caller-supplied absolute URL
// would be an SSRF surface on every page of every host. Every request template below is a path, resolved against the
// page's own origin, and read_page refuses anything that is not a path on this origin.
//
// WHY this is not a false capability claim (DECLARED-NOT-WORKING-1). The manifest is generated from the same table the
// bridge registers from, and every endpoint in it was answered 200 by a live probe on 2026-10-25 before shipping. The
// bridge reports what actually happened in window.__webmcp: supported=false when the browser has no modelContext, and
// registered=<n> only after registerTool() returned. Measured 2026-10-25 before this shipped: ideas /api/proposals
// answered 503 and was REMOVED from the manifest rather than advertised; ideas /api/sessions, q08 /api/metrics and
// POST ask.qwav.tech/api/ask answered 200. scripts/webmcp-verify.mjs re-probes every host and every tool endpoint.
//
// ROLLBACK. Revert the deploy of a worker to its previous version; the block is inert code for a browser without
// modelContext and cannot change a page's rendered output for any other client.
