-- Why (measured 2026-11-04 from qnfo-audit, not assumed): ISSUE-PROBE-CAP-1 and CAP-2 never took effect. Their migrations ran, but both match
-- the October workflow text (issue_probe_requests q ... = a.id), and ISSUE-BIRTH-DOER-PROBE-1 (2026-11-01) had already rewritten the
-- probe-request step to read v_issue_probe_intake (... = v.issue_id). The UPDATE matched no row, so fleet_tasks issue-probe-agent stayed at
-- version 5 with no cap marker while the agent was asked 23 to 28 times an hour. That step also re-asks an issue every 120 minutes, which is
-- the real driver of the 28-asks-per-issue pattern in docs/INFRA-AUDIT-2026-11-04.md.
-- How: the cap goes on the live text. An issue is asked while it has fewer than issue_probe_max_attempts (2) requests, or when its newest
-- request is older than issue_probe_retry_days (7): one ask a week at the worst, never none (a cap with no expiry strands issues).
-- idx_cf_agent_requests_probe_cap keeps the per-issue count off a full scan of cf_agent_requests (D1-OVERLOAD: rows_read is the cost).
-- Prediction: issue-probe-agent asks fall from about 25 an hour to at most the per_hour batch for issues under the cap, then to about zero
-- for capped issues; verify with SELECT substr(created_at,1,13), COUNT(*) FROM cf_agent_requests WHERE requester = 'issue-probe-agent'
-- GROUP BY 1 and with fleet_tasks.definition containing 'probe-attempt-cap-3'.
