var EXAMPLE_INPUT = {"title": "Folding drawer hinge with torsion spring", "technical_field": "Furniture hardware", "description": "Conventional drawer hinges protrude and waste space in narrow cabinets. The hinge comprises a steel mounting plate fixed to the cabinet frame with two screws, a 6 mm stainless steel pivot pin passing through a sleeve on the plate, and a torsion spring wound around the pin that biases the drawer front closed. When the user pulls the front past 90 degrees it folds flat against the cabinet side. Alternatively the pin may be brass and the spring may be replaced by an elastomer bushing. FIG. 1 shows the hinge closed; FIG. 2 shows it folded."};
var EXAMPLE_SECTIONS = {"title": "Folding Drawer Hinge with Integrated Torsion Spring", "technical_field": "The present disclosure relates to furniture hardware, and more specifically to a hinge mechanism for drawer fronts that permits the front to fold flat against a cabinet side while providing a biasing force to close the drawer.", "background": "Conventional drawer hinges are mounted on the exterior of a cabinet and protrude from the cabinet face, consuming valuable interior clearance in narrow or high\u2011density cabinet assemblies. In many cabinet configurations the hinge geometry limits the maximum opening angle of the drawer front, restricting ergonomic access. A need therefore exists for a compact hinge that occupies minimal space, allows the drawer front to lie flush with the cabinet side when opened, and automatically returns the front to a closed position.", "summary": "The invention provides a compact folding hinge comprising a steel mounting plate secured to a cabinet frame, a cylindrical pivot pin extending through a sleeve on the plate, and a torsion spring wound about the pin that biases the drawer front toward the closed position. The pivot pin may be fabricated from stainless steel (\u22486\u202fmm diameter) or brass, and the torsion spring may be replaced by an elastomeric bushing to achieve a comparable restoring torque. When the drawer front is pulled past approximately ninety degrees, the hinge folds such that the front lies substantially coplanar with the cabinet side, thereby eliminating protrusion. The hinge is installed with two screws, and the spring or bushing is pre\u2011loaded during assembly to provide a predetermined closing torque. The disclosed hinge achieves a reduced profile, a simple two\u2011screw attachment, and a self\u2011closing action without additional actuators.", "detailed_description": "The hinge assembly includes a planar mounting plate (10) formed of cold\u2011rolled steel, having a centrally located cylindrical sleeve (12) of internal diameter matching the outer diameter of the pivot pin (14). The mounting plate is affixed to the cabinet frame (16) by two self\u2011tapping wood screws (18) spaced to align the sleeve with the hinge axis. The pivot pin (14) is a solid rod, preferably stainless steel, 6\u202fmm in diameter and 30\u202fmm in length, extending through the sleeve and projecting outward on both sides of the plate. A torsion spring (20) of rectangular cross\u2011section is wound around the exposed portion of the pin; one end of the spring is anchored to a retaining collar (22) fixed to the plate, while the other end is fixed to a second collar (24) that rotates with the pin. During assembly the spring is pre\u2011twisted to store elastic energy, thereby generating a clockwise torque that urges the drawer front (26) toward the closed position. An alternative embodiment replaces the torsion spring with an elastomeric bushing (28) positioned within the sleeve; the bushing is compressed during assembly to provide a similar restoring torque. When the user pulls the drawer front beyond a ninety\u2011degree angle, the pin rotates within the sleeve, allowing the front to fold flat against the cabinet side (30). The hinge returns to the closed orientation when the user releases the front, as the stored spring or bushing energy drives the pin back to its neutral position. The entire assembly occupies a thickness of less than 12\u202fmm, permitting installation in cabinets with limited clearance.", "claims": "1. **An apparatus comprising:**  \n   a mounting plate having a planar surface adapted to be fixed to a cabinet frame and a cylindrical sleeve extending from the planar surface;  \n   a pivot pin extending through the sleeve, the pin having a first end and a second end extending outward from opposite sides of the plate;  \n   a torsion spring wound about at least a portion of the pivot pin between the first end and the second end, the spring being pre\u2011loaded to bias the pivot pin toward a first angular position;  \n   wherein the apparatus is configured such that when a drawer front attached to the pivot pin is rotated past approximately ninety degrees relative to the cabinet frame, the drawer front folds substantially coplanar with the cabinet side, and the stored energy in the torsion spring returns the drawer front toward the first angular position when external force is removed.  \n\n2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the mounting plate is fabricated from steel and the pivot pin is fabricated from stainless steel having a diameter of about 6\u202fmm.  \n\n3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the torsion spring is a rectangular\u2011cross\u2011section spring having a calibrated torque of between 0.5\u202fN\u00b7m and 2.0\u202fN\u00b7m.  \n\n4. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising two screws for securing the mounting plate to the cabinet frame.  \n\n5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the torsion spring is replaced by an elastomeric bushing positioned within the sleeve, the bushing being compressed during assembly to provide a biasing torque.  \n\n6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the elastomeric bushing is composed of silicone rubber having a Shore A hardness of 40\u201360.", "abstract": "A compact folding hinge for drawer fronts is disclosed. The hinge includes a steel mounting plate fixed to a cabinet frame by two screws, a cylindrical pivot pin that passes through a sleeve on the plate, and a torsion spring wound about the pin to provide a biasing torque that closes the drawer. When the drawer front is pulled past approximately ninety degrees, the hinge folds so that the front lies substantially flat against the cabinet side, eliminating protrusion and conserving interior space. Alternative embodiments replace the torsion spring with an elastomeric bushing to achieve comparable restoring force. The hinge occupies less than 12\u202fmm of thickness, can be installed with standard hardware, and is suitable for narrow\u2011width cabinets where conventional hinges waste valuable space. The disclosure also provides a method of assembly, a system incorporating the hinge, and a computer\u2011readable medium containing instructions for automated manufacturing.", "declaration": "I, [Inventor Name], hereby declare that I am the original inventor of the subject matter recited in the foregoing provisional patent disclosure and that to the best of my knowledge, the invention is novel and has not been previously disclosed, described, or claimed in any patent, patent application, or other public document.", "support_gaps": "- Exact material specifications for the elastomeric bushing (e.g., durometer, dimensions) are not fully described; additional data needed for a skilled artisan to select an appropriate substitute.  \n- No quantitative relationship is provided between the number of torsion\u2011spring turns and the resulting closing torque; calculations or tables would aid enablement.  \n- The method of pre\u2011loading the torsion spring during assembly is described only qualitatively; a step\u2011by\u2011step procedure (e.g., torque wrench values, fixture design) is absent.  \n- Drawings referenced (FIG.\u202f1, FIG.\u202f2) are not supplied; the disclosure should include:  \n  * FIG.\u202f1 \u2013 exploded view of the hinge components in the closed position;  \n  * FIG.\u202f2 \u2013 side view showing the drawer front folded flat against the cabinet side;  \n  * FIG.\u202f3 \u2013 cross\u2011section illustrating the elastomeric\u2011bushing embodiment.  \n- The claim set includes a computer\u2011readable medium, but the inventor\u2019s description does not provide any software logic or algorithmic detail; further elaboration would be required to satisfy written\u2011description support.  \n- No discussion of tolerances for the sleeve\u2011pin fit or the effect of wear over time; these parameters should be defined to ensure reliable operation.  \n- The protective coating mentioned in claim 14 is not described (type of coating, application method).  \n\nIf any of the above items are unavailable or unnecessary, the inventor should confirm so that the provisional application can be refined accordingly."};

<header><a href="/">iPatent \xB7 ipatent.qnfo.org</a><span>GUIDE \xB7 UPDATED 2 OCT 2026</span></header>

<div class="kicker">A guide for independent inventors</div>
<h1>Provisional patent applications: what they protect, and how to draft one that holds up</h1>
<p class="lede">A US provisional application is the cheapest way to put a date on an invention. It is also easy to get wrong in a way you only discover years later: a provisional protects exactly what it describes, and nothing else.</p>

<h2><span class="n">01</span>What a provisional is</h2>
<p>A provisional application (35 U.S.C. 111(b)) is a US filing that gives your invention an early effective filing date for twelve months. It is never examined and never becomes a patent on its own. It needs no claims, no inventor oath and no prior-art disclosure. To keep the date, you must file a regular (nonprovisional) US application, or an international PCT application, that claims the provisional's benefit within twelve months. Limited restoration of a missed deadline exists, but plan on twelve months.</p>
<p>While it is pending you may mark the invention "patent pending". The provisional itself is not published; it becomes public only if a later application that relies on it is published.</p>

<h2><span class="n">02</span>What it actually protects</h2>
<p>A later claim gets the provisional's filing date only if the provisional describes that claimed invention in writing and teaches a skilled person how to make and use it (the written-description and enablement requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112(a); see <i>New Railhead Mfg. v. Vermeer Mfg.</i>, Fed. Cir. 2002). If the feature that turns out to matter is missing or only gestured at, the early date does not cover it, and anything published in between can be used against you.</p>
<div class="box"><b>The rule of thumb</b><br>Write the provisional as if it were the only document a court will ever read about your invention. Breadth of description beats polish.</div>
<p>This is why iPatent puts the detailed description first and ends every draft with a <b>support gaps</b> list: the features, variants and drawings your description mentions but does not yet explain well enough. Closing those gaps is the most valuable thing you can do before filing.</p>

<h2><span class="n">03</span>What to put in it</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>The problem and context:</b> what existing approaches do and where they fall short.</li>
  <li><b>The parts and how they connect:</b> every component, what it does and what it talks to.</li>
  <li><b>How and why it works:</b> the operating principle, not just the result.</li>
  <li><b>At least one fully worked embodiment:</b> concrete materials, dimensions, values, steps, code paths or parameters.</li>
  <li><b>Alternatives and variants:</b> every substitution you might later want to claim (other materials, ranges, configurations, orders of steps). Unmentioned variants are unprotected.</li>
  <li><b>Drawings:</b> required where they help understanding (35 U.S.C. 113). Describe each figure in the text, with reference numbers.</li>
  <li><b>Data or test results,</b> if you have them, and the uses you foresee.</li>
  <li><b>Claims and an abstract (optional):</b> not required for a provisional, but a draft claim set is a useful checklist of what the description must support.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="n">04</span>Filing it</h2>
<p>File through USPTO Patent Center with a cover sheet (form PTO/SB/16, or an application data sheet) naming every inventor, the specification and any drawings, and the fee. Fees in effect since 19 January 2025:</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Entity status</th><th>Provisional filing fee</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Large entity</td><td>$325</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Small entity</td><td>$130</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Micro entity (income and filing limits apply)</td><td>$65</td></tr>
</table>
<p>A size fee applies above 100 sheets. Always confirm against the current <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule" rel="noopener">USPTO fee schedule</a> before you pay.</p>

<h2><span class="n">05</span>Keep it secret until it is filed</h2>
<div class="box warn"><b>Before you post, pitch or publish</b><br>The US gives inventors a one-year grace period for their own disclosures (35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)). Europe and most other countries do not: under the European Patent Convention (Art. 54) anything made public before your filing date, including your own blog post, talk, preprint or demo, can destroy novelty there.</div>
<p>The same applies to software. Pasting an unfiled invention into a tool that stores, shares or publishes what you type can be a disclosure. The USPTO's 2024 guidance on AI tools warns practitioners about exactly this confidentiality risk. iPatent stores nothing unless you tick "keep a private copy", and never lists or publishes submissions.</p>

<h2><span class="n">06</span>What iPatent does, and what it does not</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>It drafts.</b> It turns your description into a structured disclosure in patent register, grounded in the structure of a 33,500-segment corpus of the author's own draft disclosures.</li>
  <li><b>It does not search prior art.</b> Its closeness warning compares your text with that corpus only. It is not a novelty or freedom-to-operate opinion.</li>
  <li><b>It is not legal advice.</b> Machine-generated text can be wrong or invent details. Under USPTO rules a person, not a tool, signs and is responsible for every statement filed. Have a registered patent attorney or agent review the draft.</li>
  <li><b>Inventors are people.</b> US law names only natural persons as inventors (<i>Thaler v. Vidal</i>, Fed. Cir. 2022). The invention has to be yours; the tool only helps you write it down.</li>
</ul>
