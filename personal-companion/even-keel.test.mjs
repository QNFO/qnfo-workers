// EK-3 offline suite (personal-companion 1.44.17, roadmap row 1750, agent_issues 1000714, charter pillar: reach, ENSEMBLE-POLICY-1).
// Until 1.44.17 the even-keel reviewer was chosen from a model family called "ensemble-policy-1" that no model has, so balanceCheck answered
// "unavailable" for every piece and companion_audits.balance_score is NULL on every row. Proves: the reviewer is found (a family other than the
// writer's, a fresh one when there is one); it is asked only after the grounding check and both fact-check judges pass; a score under the bar
// stops the piece at stage "balance" with a "one-sided:" problem; an unreadable or failing reviewer is replaced once and then fails open with the
// reason recorded; the audit of published pieces does not run it; the score reaches companion_audits and quality_json; the writer is told the bar;
// the revision of a one-sided draft carries the even-keel note, not the fact-revision text.
// Run: node personal-companion/even-keel.test.mjs   -> prints "N passed, 0 failed"
