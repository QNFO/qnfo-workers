-- VACUOUS-FLAP-1 (2026-10-28, charter pillar ops; root cause for ROOT-CAUSE-1 families METRIC-UNMEASURED-1 and CF-OBS-ISSUE-1 flapping).
-- Evidence (qnfo-audit, 2026-10-28): 190 issues were closed by remediation_verification_autoclose_* while their active contract was a VACUOUS-PROBE ("measures nothing"); 50 of them reopened, 122 reopens in all. #1000473 reopened 28 times while its probe passed every ~80 min with observed=0.
-- Change: an already-reopened issue is no longer auto-closed on a vacuous contract's pass. First closes are unchanged (no backlog growth for new issues). Both triggers are recreated otherwise byte-for-byte as of 2026-10-28.
-- Prediction: METRIC-UNMEASURED-1 and CF-OBS-ISSUE-1 reopens_7d (22 and 50 on 2026-10-28) fall by at least half within 7 days; guard: open_agent_issues rises by at most the count of chronic flappers (<= 55) and issues_open_over_120m does not worsen by more than that.
-- APPLY-BY: ci
-- DB: qnfo-audit
-- Backup: schema of both triggers is in this file's Rollback section (the pre-change text is the 2026-10-12-autoclose-all-contracts.sql lineage); take a D1 time-travel bookmark before apply.
-- Rollback: DROP both triggers and recreate them without the VACUOUS-FLAP-1 AND NOT (...) block (the clause is self-contained and marked by that comment).
