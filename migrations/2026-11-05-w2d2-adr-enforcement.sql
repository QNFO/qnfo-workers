'Charter pillar: security. Serves RM-ADR-013-014-ENFORCEMENT-1 (roadmap_implementation 115). living-paper adr_enforcement rule adr014-publish-authorship ships in mode observe (decision_log, session-w2d2). Replay over production found 0 of the 296 papers first published since 2026-09-01 would be refused.

Change in qnfo-lifecycle paperLedgerChainTick: when the rule is in mode observe, set_at is seven or more days old, adr014_publish_audit has no row from the last seven days and v_adr014_authorship_status.violations_since_adr is 0, run UPDATE adr_enforcement SET mode = ''enforce'', set_at = now WHERE rule = ''adr014-publish-authorship'' AND mode = ''observe'' on living-paper and write one cloud_ops_events row (kind adr014-promote) naming the counts it read. The revert is the same statement with ''off''. A tick that finds an audit row leaves the rule in observe and names the writer (the actor column) in the event.

Closing probe: code-probe below (the code state is the defect until the promotion exists; the D1 state follows seven days later).

Decision (decision_log, session-w2d2): a published version is not edited in place for its byline (ADR-013); the paper takes the owner byline when the pipeline next writes a new version of it, through the PAPER-LEDGER-1 path (papers.change_actor and papers.change_reason set in the same UPDATE, so the ledger keeps the old authors in meta_before). Revert: the ledger row names the previous authors.

Change in qnfo-research-exec paperFormatTick (the sweep that already rewrites stored papers and sets a per-paper change_reason): when it writes a paper whose authors do not name the owner, set authors to the AUTHOR constant in the same UPDATE and say so in change_reason; never change status. The file is under another session''s claim at the time of filing; the code loop takes it when the claim lapses.

'Charter pillar: security. Serves RM-ADR-013-014-ENFORCEMENT-1 (roadmap_implementation 115). ADR-013 as the docs quote it: each published version of the QNFO-ULA is immutable (docs/license/for-QNFO-license/README.md). The paper ledger now has a hash chain; the licence texts have only a size and corruption check (qnfo-lifecycle runUlaCheck: at least 64000 bytes, three corruption patterns).

Change in runUlaCheck: keep a table ula_version_pins in qnfo-audit (migration, append-only: version, url, sha256, first_seen, a BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE abort) holding the sha256 of the body served at legal.qnfo.org, qnfo.org/legal/license and qnfo.org/legal/license for the current version; a served body whose hash differs from the pinned hash of the same version is a finding (result.findings, verdict DEGRADED, a cloud_ops_events row kind ula-changed) and never overwrites the pin. A new version is a new pin.
