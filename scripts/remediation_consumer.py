# REMEDIATION-CONSUMER-1 (2026-09-30)
"""Consume the qnfo-audit `remediation_contracts` registry.

MEASURED STATE BEFORE THIS FILE
  qnfo-audit held 18 active rows in `remediation_contracts`, 8 enabled rows in
  `remediation_modules`, and TWO armed auto-close triggers
  (remediation_verification_autoclose_ins / _upd) that close an `agent_issues`
  row the moment a `remediation_verifications` row lands with pass=1, a trusted
  transport and non-empty expected/observed. What did NOT exist was any process
  that read the contract table, so every contract sat at attempts=0 /
  last_verdict=NULL and the auto-close machine could never fire once.

CONTRACT (do not weaken)
  1. A probe is executed only when it is a LITERAL read-only SELECT. Anything
     else is SKIPPED and stamped `probe-not-machine-executable`; the issue stays
     OPEN. Fail-closed by design: a guessed pass would auto-close a live defect.
  2. The probe MUST return one row carrying `expected` and `observed` (by name,
     or positionally as the first two columns). The consumer never invents either
     value - both come from the probe - so the
     `remediation_verification_evidence_guard_ins` BEFORE-INSERT guard
     (VACUOUS-VERIFICATION-EVIDENCE-1) cannot be tripped and no close can rest on
     a fabricated expectation.
  3. pass = 1 only when expected == observed and both are non-empty.
  4. The verification transport must be `trusted=1` in `transport_trust`, or the
     row is not written at all.
  5. This consumer writes no repository file except its own ci-status artifact.

RUNTIME PROBES (PROBE-TRANSPORT-MONOCULTURE-1, agent_issues 2060, 2026-10-06)
  From 2026-10-01 to 2026-10-06 every automated verification (1707 rows) was a
  SQL read of qnfo-audit: fleet-control's tick selects verify_transport =
  'd1-query' only and this file knew only D1. transport_trust listed nine trusted
  runtime transports with no executor behind any of them, so a runtime defect (a
  slow page, a dead route) could only be closed by narrative. This file now runs
  runtime probes from the GitHub-hosted runner, a vantage outside the Cloudflare
  account whose code it checks, as transport `runner-https`. It is
  the mirror of PROBE-TRANSPORTS-1 (agent_issues 2059): there qnfo-fleet-control
  runs `external-https` from Cloudflare against hosts OUTSIDE the fleet and
  refuses fleet hosts (a same-account fetch is not independent, issue 1190);
  here the runner checks the fleet's own hosts from outside. The two transports
  never select each other's contracts. The probe is declarative JSON, never
  code: {"url": "https://...", "status": 200, "contains": "...", "max_ms": 3000}.
  6. GET only, https only, no credentials, hosts in HTTPS_HOSTS only (every
     redirect hop too), at most HTTPS_READ_CAP bytes read.
  7. expected is the literal token 'ok'; observed is 'ok' or a failure token
     (status=404, missing-marker, slow=4123ms, error:<type>). No response body
     ever leaves the probe: this repository is public.
  8. A pass holds the contract for RT_HOLD_D days before it closes (the
     REMEDIATION-HOLD-1 rule fleet-control applies to d1-query); a fail streak of
     max_attempts after a pass or closure reopens the issue (REMEDIATION-REOPEN-1).
     A module 'runtime-liveness-v1' contract never closes; when it has no issue
     and fails max_attempts times in a row it files one RUNTIME-PROBE-FAIL-1
     issue and adopts it, so the autoclose trigger closes that issue on recovery.
  9. Each run writes metric runtime_verified_share_24h (share of the last 24h of
     verifications on a trusted, independent, runtime-observable transport); its
     trigger breaches if this runner stops, which a Cloudflare cron evaluates.
