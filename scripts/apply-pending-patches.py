"""APPLY-PENDING-1 -- land every patch script whose anchors still match.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Two defects were measured on 2026-09-29 by scripts/applier-doctor.py over the
31 scripts/*patch*.py in this repo:

  * #1395 CI-APPLIER-NEVER-APPLIES-1 -- patch scripts sat in scripts/ for days
    with a matching applier workflow yet were never applied to main. The doctor
    classifies these as `applied-now` (the patch applies cleanly to the current
    tree, therefore it was never landed).
  * #1381 FAILURE-ARTIFACT-LOSS-1 -- appliers that only commit on success leave
    no trace when they fail, so a silently-dead applier is indistinguishable
    from one that never ran.
  * PARTIAL-APPLY-1 (new, measured 2026-09-29) -- a fail-closed patcher that
    edits several files and then aborts on a later anchor leaves the tree
    half-patched. driftguard-label-and-lifecycle-sot-patch.py rewrote
    scripts/deploy-drift-guard.py and reported raw_put.py already-applied, then
    FAIL-CLOSED on qnfo-lifecycle/worker.js -- two files mutated, one not.
  * REVERT-COLLATERAL-1 (new, measured 2026-09-29) -- the envelope's own revert
    ran `git checkout -- .`, which reverts EVERY tracked file in the worktree.
    A single late fail-closed patcher therefore silently discarded every patch
    that had already landed earlier in the SAME run, while this script still
    recorded those earlier scripts as `landed`. That is the exact mechanism by
    which CI-APPLIER-NEVER-APPLIES-1 keeps recurring after being "fixed": the
    doctor sees a matching applier, the run reports success, and the work is
    gone. Revert is now path-scoped (see revert_paths).

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Runs every scripts/*patch*.py inside a transactional envelope:

  snapshot  -> git status --porcelain + per-path content hash
  run       -> subprocess with REPO_ROOT + a hard per-script timeout
  rc != 0   -> revert ONLY the paths this script changed
  rc == 0 and tree unchanged -> already-applied
  rc == 0 and tree changed   -> landed

It never commits and never deploys; the calling workflow does that, so this
script stays safe to run anywhere. It always writes
ci-status/applier-doctor.json, so a run that lands nothing is still visible
through the GitHub contents API without the Actions API.

Exit codes
  0  ran to completion (however many scripts landed)
  3  no repo root, or no patch scripts found (nothing was classified)

# WHY RUNTIME-VERIFIED AND NOT A STATIC LIST
#   The first attempt at this list (scripts/applier-classify-signature-and-retire-patch.py,
#   2026-09-29) never landed: it pins the pre-2026-09-30 classify() text, so it
#   exits 3 on every run, and the list was lost with it. A static list is also
#   unsafe in principle -- the tree moves after the list is written, so a stale
#   entry can silently drop a fix that was never applied. Each entry therefore
#   carries `evidence = (file, token)` and the applier is skipped ONLY IF that
#   token is found in that file AT RUN TIME. If the evidence is gone, the applier
#   runs normally. Retirement is fail-closed; execution is fail-open. A generic
#   token (a table name, whitespace) is never accepted as evidence.
