// BREACH-DOCTOR-1 offline suite (qnfo-fleet-control 0.52.0, agent_issues 1000266): slices the BREACH-DOCTOR-1 block out of worker.js and replays it against an in-memory
// node:sqlite D1 stub that carries the live column lists, the live close-sync triggers and migrations/2026-10-26-breach-doctor.sql.
// Proves: the validators refuse a playbook that writes free text, a second statement, a table off the allowlist (ops_config and human_actions are off it), a statement with no top-level id = ?1 predicate or with an OR beside it, or a DELETE; kill switch off writes nothing; measure mode records the
// would-do and acts on nothing; a playbook younger than 30 minutes runs in measure and an older one acts, bound to one issue each, with revert_sql, decision_log and events; the
// caps defer and never stop; verify needs two passes and a failed verify, an SQL error, an expired lease or a no-op action on an open issue is failed (on an issue closed meanwhile it is superseded); two failures in 24 hours demote the rule, which is released to a
// one-case-a-tick trial after 60 minutes (a failed trial case demotes it again, a verified one restores it, failures count from the last change of standing) and
// three failures of one issue file one self issue and slow its retries to once in 120 minutes (a rate with a release, not a permanent stop); unowned issues are classified critical first, owned and young
// issues never; the doctor's own BREACH-DOCTOR-1: issues are classified and counted but match no playbook and take no action; breaches_undiagnosed_over_60m keeps counting an issue classified
// "unclassified" (coverage is not a diagnosis); the seeded playbook-gap row is measure and files no issue (a gap issue carries no anchor the code loop can edit; the gap stays recorded by family in
// breach_diagnoses and v_breach_doctor_status; the self issue after 3 failed cases is the only issue the doctor files by itself, and it names a doer once the trust pair is listed); switched on with
// UPDATE breach_playbooks SET mode = 'on' WHERE rule_id = 'playbook-gap', a gap issue is filed once per family (owner prose and the catch-all are skipped; none while 3 are open); the age
// gate is 60 minutes (BREACH-DOCTOR-FIX-1, bounded to 10..120) and the undiagnosed metric flags at min(120, gate + 60) minutes; an in-flight case with an expired lease is failed in measure and left alone only when the switch is off; the owner-card and file-issue kinds work (the owner card keeps an empty default_in_effect and stays open with the live human_actions triggers, views and markers on the table, for every owner reason; a card a trigger closed does not verify the handed-owner case); a verify that reads pending-<reason> keeps an applied case waiting until its lease ends, supersedes it when the issue closed meanwhile, and fails it after one ok pass or on any other value (PENDING-VERIFY-1); an injection payload in an issue body or plan reason reaches no table the doctor writes; one tick at a time, the lock is
// released after an error; the tick never throws; the call site is on every */10 tick; the mirror and VERSION match. BREACH-DOCTOR-GATE-1 (0.53.1): the id-bound gate is structural: every form two reviewers
// ran through bdWriteWhy and real SQLite (INSERT ... SELECT with the id predicate only in the upsert's WHERE, NOT / = 0 / NOT NULL on the id conjunct, UPDATE ... FROM, a predicate in a subquery) is refused, a table of
// legitimate shapes passes and changes only issue 1 in SQLite, the five seed playbooks pass unchanged, and a property test over 12,000 generated statements proves that no statement the gate accepts changes another issue.
// Output MUST contain "0 failed" on success.   node qnfo-fleet-control/breach-doctor.test.mjs
