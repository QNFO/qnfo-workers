"""Offline tests for MIGRATION-RUNNER-1 (scripts/apply_migrations.py, transformation lever T5.3).

A fake Cloudflare D1 (an in-memory sqlite3 database behind cf_ops_actions.call) stands in for qnfo-audit. Proves: a file
without "-- APPLY-BY: ci" is skipped (the 75 hand-applied files never run again); an opted-in file needs a known DB and a
Rollback line; DELETE/DROP needs a BACKUP table that exists and is non-empty, checked before anything runs; statements are
split by SQLite's tokenizer (a semicolon inside a string literal is not a boundary); an applied file is recorded in
migration_runs and skipped on the next run with the same sha256, and runs again when its content changes; a failing
statement records an error row, files one deduped MIGRATION-APPLY-FAILED-1 issue and returns 1; --check refuses a bad
header without touching D1; every migration already in migrations/ is skipped by --check.
Run: python3 scripts/apply_migrations_test.py   (prints "N passed, 0 failed")

# 2026-10-20, CHECK constraints included), replaying it is a no-op, decision_log stays append-only, and every code-probe marker it registers
# really occurs in scripts/apply_migrations.py (a detector that cannot pass would file its own issue). The control rows come with a tested-alternate
# probe each (CONTROL-ALT-PROBES-1): a control with an alternate, no stamp and no probe reads 'no-probe', and the live hourly detector
# fm-control-alternate-undrilled (SELECT controls_untested_without_probe FROM v_control_alternate_untested, expected 0) turns red on it. The fixture
# therefore carries the live control_alternate_probes table and the live text of the three views that read it (v_control_alternate_status,
# v_control_alternate_untested, v_path_coverage_gaps; read from qnfo-audit.sqlite_master on 2026-10-20), so that defect is visible here.
