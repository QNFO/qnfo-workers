// OBJECTION-FIND-1 offline suite (personal-companion 1.25.3, charter pillar: personal; agent_issues 2552).
// Proves: the objection is read from wherever the essay contract lets the writer place it (a heading naming it, a paragraph that
// raises it in so many words, or a section whose heading challenges the claim), not only from a heading containing "objection";
// a piece with no objection still reads empty, so the "objection too thin" rail keeps failing it; composePiece and the reframe
// parse both use the finder.
// Run: node personal-companion/objection-find.test.mjs   -> prints "N passed, 0 failed"
