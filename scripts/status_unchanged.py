"""STATUS-NOOP-SKIP-1: tell a CI status-artifact writer whether a freshly written JSON status file differs from
the committed one ONLY in per-run stamps, so the writer can skip a commit that carries no information.

Measured 2026-10-01 over the last 40 commits of each file: ci-status/remediation-consumer.json changed in 6
(33 of 39 commits were stamp-only) and ci-status/remediation-bridge.json in 16 (23 of 39). Those commits, plus the
unmangle status file, were about 100 of the 249 bot commits pushed to main in 3 hours; every main push also
starts CodeQL runs that hit "API rate limit exceeded for installation" and report a configuration error.

STATUS-THROTTLE-1 (ACTIONS-QUOTA-1, 2026-10-02): the stamp-only skip was not enough. In the 24h to 2026-10-02 09Z
main took 648 commits and 467 carried [skip ci]: canonical-deploy 127 (its file held nothing but head and ts),
remediation-bridge 108, fleet-autoaudit 105, remediation-consumer 84. [skip ci] does not stop CodeQL default setup,
so each of those started a three-language CodeQL analysis (about 70% of all Push-on-main CodeQL runs), all drawing
on the installation API budget that the SARIF upload then found empty. With --throttle-min N a writer commits a
change that keeps every OUTCOME key the same at most once per N minutes; an outcome change (ok, job_status, error,
a gate's exit code, ...) still commits at once. The authoritative records are unchanged (D1 rows, the deploy
ledger, the run's own uploaded artifact); only the git snapshot is batched.

usage: status_unchanged.py FILE [--ignore k1,k2,...] [--ref REF]
                                [--throttle-min N] [--outcome k1,k2,...] [--stamp-key KEY]
       (REF defaults to HEAD; use origin/main after a fetch)
exit 0  skip the commit:
          FILE equals its version at REF apart from the ignored top-level keys, or
          (--throttle-min) FILE has the same top-level keys and the same OUTCOME values as REF's version, and REF's
          version is younger than N minutes (its STAMP-KEY, else the commit time of REF's last change to FILE)
exit 1  commit: anything else, including a new file, unreadable or invalid JSON, a non-object, an outcome change,
        a changed key set, or an age that cannot be established (fail-safe)

Default ignored keys are pure run stamps: head (the triggering SHA), ts, spent_ms, verifier, actor.
Outcome keys (ok, job_status, counts, guard_exit, repair_exit, ...) are never ignored. Pass --ignore "" to ignore
nothing (a file made only of stamps then commits on the throttle's heartbeat instead of never).
