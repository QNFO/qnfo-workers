"""version-bump-guard.py - VERSION-BUMP-GUARD-1 (2026-09-29, issue 1371).

WHY THIS EXISTS
  Three independent mechanisms decide whether a worker fix reaches live:
    * scripts/fleet-autoaudit.py --apply  -> redeploys only workers STRICTLY AHEAD by
      NUMERIC version comparison;
    * .github/workflows/deploy-drift.yml  -> compares VERSION strings;
    * scripts/mirror-guard.py             -> compares source vs its deployed mirror.
  A worker fix committed WITHOUT bumping the `var VERSION = "..."` constant is invisible to
  ALL THREE. Repo and live report the SAME version, so nothing is "ahead", nothing is
  "drifted", and the fix never reaches live - while every check stays green. That is a silent
  never-deploys class, and it is not hypothetical:

    LIVE INSTANCE OF THE CLASS (verified 2026-09-29)
      qnfo-backlog-exec HEALTH-PROBE-BUDGET-1 (#1368) - repo qnfo-backlog-exec/worker.js is
      33,159 bytes, the live script is 33,161 bytes, and BOTH report
      VERSION 2.0.0-full-register-inventory. Version comparison sees parity; the auto-deployer
      sees "not strictly ahead"; so the committed fix is structurally undeployable.

    SECOND LIVE INSTANCE (verified 2026-09-29)
      worker_live_audit (the fleet self-audit table) still records qnfo-ops as
      2.37.14-callglm-reasoning while live is 2.37.20-selfheal-analyzer-live - a six-version
      lag - because the audit writer had no scheduled writer and the ledger/audit comparisons
      built on it returned false verdicts.

WHAT IT DOES
  For every worker entry bundle that CHANGED between two refs, extract the VERSION constant on
  both sides. If the bundle bytes changed but VERSION did not, exit 1 and name the worker.

  Formatting-only changes are reported too, deliberately: the deployer cannot distinguish a
  whitespace edit from a real fix either, so neither can this guard.

  VERSION-AHEAD-1 (2026-10-02, WORK-CLAIM-1): when both sides carry a numeric core
  ("<v?>1.18.5-suffix"), the new core must be STRICTLY AHEAD of the base's. A changed string is
  not enough: on 2026-10-02 five PRs claimed qnfo-fleet-dashboard 1.17.2, 1.17.3, 1.17.8 and
  1.18.x twice each, and a collision resolved by keeping "1.17.2-b" over main's "1.17.2-a"
  passes a string-change check while qnfo-fleet-control/version-compare.mjs rule 5 ranks equal
  cores with different suffixes UNORDERABLE (the drift redeployer never acts on them) and the
  deployment_history monotonic trigger refuses a lower version. On a pull request the base is
  the merge-base with the base branch tip, so this compares against what main holds NOW: a PR
  that kept a number another PR already merged goes red. Versions without a numeric core are
  not ordered (the string-change rule still applies). Measured over the 343 bundle bumps on
  main from 2026-09-30 12:00 to 2026-10-02: 339 strictly ahead, 0 behind, 4 equal-core
  (qnfo-fleet-control 0.4.39-selfstate-obs1..4, which the comparator could never order).

USAGE
  python3 scripts/version-bump-guard.py <base_ref> <head_ref>
  python3 scripts/version-bump-guard.py                 # falls back to HEAD~1..HEAD

EXIT
  0  nothing to check, or every changed bundle bumped VERSION
  1  at least one changed bundle kept its VERSION   (the defect)
  3  cannot evaluate (bad ref, git unavailable, unreadable blob) - fail-closed, never green

ADVERSARIAL
  This guard proves only that a VERSION STRING changed alongside the bytes. It cannot prove the
  change is correct, that the version was bumped in the right direction, or that the worker
  deploys. A worker can be bumped and still never reach live; that is deploy-drift.yml's job.
