-- PLAN-STARVATION-1 + DISABLED-TRIGGER-TICKET-1 (2026-11-05, pillar autonomy; metrics issues_over_24h_no_doer, driver_drain_24h, open_agent_issues, orphan_issues_no_live_path).
-- WHAT WAS READ (qnfo-audit, 2026-11-05 03Z):
--   planner   issue_plans held 0 rows planned in the last 12 h (about 8 planner tasks a day before 2026-11-04T15Z; 34 of the planner's last 77 tasks merged). planIssues was shut by its
--             work-in-progress gate: 50 queued code_tasks rows on 21 files against code_plan_wip 40, while issue intake and this RED-DRAIN-1 dispatch refill the queue up to
--             MAX_OPEN_TASKS (48) whenever the loop frees a slot, so an issue with no code-task line never reached a doer. qnfo-code-orchestrator 0.48.2 counts files in motion and keeps
--             6 slots for the planner on the intake side; this file does the same for the RED-DRAIN-1 dispatch (step 3 of fleet_tasks red-drain, LIMIT 5 an hour): it adds nothing while
--             42 or more tasks are queued, so the last 6 slots of the queue stay with the planner.
--   tickets   Six open METRIC-TRIGGER tickets belong to triggers that were disabled by a recorded decision (enabled = 0: 341 owner-outcome, 404 owner-outcome, 409 duplicate of 3689,
--             1868 suppressed until 20 judged decisions exist, 5916 duplicate and contradicts the owner directive 2026-10-26 pub-gate-v4-no-withdraw, 5944 duplicate of 9901). Each ticket's
--             monitoring contract probes v_metric_trigger_state for that trigger id, a row a disabled trigger does not have, so none can ever converge (they were counted as
--             no-doer, unprobed or orphan issues for 10 to 30 days). Two have an enabled parent in metric_deps (409 -> 3689 ticket 99938, 5944 -> 9901 ticket 100301): superseded by that ticket;
--             the other four are closed as moot with the trigger notes as evidence. Re-enabling a trigger files a new ticket, so nothing is lost.
-- WHAT THIS FILE ADDS
--   1. fleet_tasks red-drain step 3 (the code-task dispatch) gets `AND queued < 42` (QUEUE-HEADROOM-1); everything else in the workflow is byte for byte as before.
--   2. The six dead-end tickets are closed with evidence (close_channel session:breach-remediation), their contracts superseded; before-state in bak_20261105_disabled_trigger_tickets.
--   3. Detector fm-disabled-trigger-ticket-open (expected 0) so a later disabled trigger with an open ticket is seen within the hour, and fm-planner-silent (the planner wrote a verdict in the last 12 h).
-- Prediction: issue_plans gets rows again within 3 h of the deploy (>= 20 rows in 12 h, >= 3 queued planner tasks a day); driver_drain_24h stays above 0.05; open_agent_issues -6; orphan_issues_no_live_path -6 or fewer.
