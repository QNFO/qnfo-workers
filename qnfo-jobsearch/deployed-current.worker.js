// qnfo-jobsearch: verified-claims job matcher (JOBSEARCH-1). Charter pillar: personal.
// Hourly cron fetches public ATS feeds (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby) plus Remotive and Arbeitnow, gates and scores each posting
// against the owner's claim ledger, assembles a tailored resume and note ONLY from ledger sentences, re-verifies every output
// line, and stores the result in D1 (jobsearch_matches). Nothing is ever sent: status moves pending_owner_approval -> approved/rejected/applied
// by the owner (POST needs x-loop-token). No LinkedIn/Indeed scraping (LinkedIn User Agreement s8.2).
// JOBSEARCH-OPS-1 (1.1.0): e-mailed-code owner sign-in via qnfo-email (no secret to manage), feed health and retry, self-healing runs, posting lifecycle (expired), dedupe, retention, GET /api/ops self-report.
// JOBSEARCH-OUTCOME-1 (1.2.0): append-only status events, outcome funnel (applied, replies, interviews, offers), reply rate of applications older than 21 days, metrics jobsearch_reply_rate_90d / jobsearch_interview_rate_90d / jobsearch_applied_30d written each run, no_reply after 21 days.
// JOBSEARCH-PROFILE-1 (1.3.0): yes/no search survey, role families drawn from the whole record (policy, transport and planning, data, product, program, research, consulting, nonprofit, GIS, contracts, social policy), location gates from the owner answers (Netherlands and remote by default, US and other on-site only when selected), likes and dislikes teach the search, rejected matches stay hidden, "check a job" analysis of a pasted link or text.
// JOBSEARCH-CV-1 (1.5.0): the CV is part of this worker (page /cv): a yes/no interview that builds the claim bank, review of unconfirmed claims, roles, achievements and publications edited in D1, a resume per job (summary, roles, selected work, education, skills) and a cover note, history and backup. The search is tied to that bank (evidence the owner can back up weighs more; what the CV lacks is shown as a gap), decided postings (rejected, applied, approved) never come back under another id, rejections carry a reason the search learns from, and a wider net: stretch matches outside the stated preferences, more boards and aggregators.
// Routes: GET / (web UI) | GET /api | GET /api/matches | GET /api/matches/:id | GET /api/runs | GET /api/ledger | POST /api/run | POST /api/matches/:id/status | GET /health
// Port of the jobsearch/ Python modules (tests: jobsearch/test_jobsearch.py, qnfo-jobsearch/worker.test.mjs).

// JOBSEARCH-LLM-RERANK-1: reorder-only re-rank of the top passing postings.
// The model may only reorder and add one sentence of reason per posting; it never writes resume or note text
// (drafts are still assembled from the ledger afterwards and re-verified). A failed, malformed or empty answer
// leaves the deterministic order untouched. The call goes through the qnfo-ai service binding with caller
// qnfo-jobsearch, and is skipped when it would cost more than the cheapest Workers AI model (BUDGET-SOFT-ROUTE-1).
// Working path (the first version asked a service binding named AI for an infer route that qnfo-ai does not have, and this worker never declared that binding,
// so it returned the deterministic order on every run). The model is called through the QNFO_AI service binding (props caller qnfo-jobsearch,
// CLAUDE.md 1703: no key copy) on the router's chat route, pinned to one cheap Workers AI model (BUDGET-SOFT-ROUTE-1: the router downgrades at a cap, never refuses).
// Deterministic guards, none of which trusts the model: (1) the answer must order every one of the numbered postings exactly once, otherwise the
// order stands; (2) a reason is shown only when reasonOk accepts it: one plain sentence, no first or second person, no markup or link, and every number
// and proper noun in it already appears in the posting or in the deterministic signals (a model cannot add a claim about the owner or the employer);
// (3) only match.why gets an "LLM: " line: score, tier, flags, the posting and the drafts are never touched, and the resume and note are built afterwards
// from the ledger and re-verified, so no model word can reach them. The outcome of each run is written to jobsearch_meta rerank_status.
