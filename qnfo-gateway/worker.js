var VERSION="3.48.2-codeagent"; // 3.48.0 PLAIN-STANDARD-1 (2026-10-28, pillar reach, agent_issues 1000476; minor: the plain-language summary now has a hard readability gate): plainPrompt asks for at most two figures, one everyday comparison, terms defined inline and sentences under 20 words; plainBuild regenerates once and flags a result above Flesch-Kincaid grade 9 as gated, which is never stored or shown (a gated build keeps the old row and waits 6 hours); plainFill queues stored summaries above grade 9 for regeneration, hardest first. qnfo-gateway/plain-standard.test.mjs. // 3.47.0 BP26-AI-ACT-ART50-1 + BP26-PROVENANCE-MARKING-1 (2026-10-28, pillars research and security, agent_issues 1000341 and 1000335): every paper page carries a visible AI label (AI-generated, or AI-assisted only where paper_provenance names a reviewer), JSON-LD creditText / digitalSourceType / isAIGenerated and, when the secret PROVENANCE_SIGNING_KEY is set, a signed Ed25519 sidecar at /papers/<slug>/provenance.json linked by <link rel="c2pa-manifest">, the public key at /.well-known/provenance-key.json, an hourly sweep that signs 40 unsigned papers and files each in qnfo-audit asset_provenance; the footer and the JSON-LD of qnfo.org pages say papers are written by AI. Absent secret = no sidecar, no link. qnfo-gateway/provenance.test.mjs. // 3.45.0 PAPER-PIDS-1 slice (2026-10-28, pillar research): per-paper CITATION.cff, CSL-JSON and BibTeX at /api/papers/<slug>.cff|.csl.json|.bib, built from the same open record as the JSON API and OAI-PMH (BP26-PAPER-PIDS-1, agent_issues 1000338).
/* 3.46.0 PAPER-PIDS-HASH-1 (2026-10-28, pillar research, agent_issues 1000338; minor): GET /papers/<slug>/v/<version> (alias /api/papers/<slug>/v/<version>) serves that version's Markdown with X-Content-SHA256 and an immutable cache header for a superseded version; /api/papers/<slug> returns sha256 and version_url. 3.45.0 note: */
// 3.44.2 BP26-EDGE-SECURITY-1 (2026-10-26, agent_issues 1000356, pillar security; patch): the apex qnfo.org answered HTML pages with no frame protection (measured 2026-10-26: the *.qnfo.org hosts get X-Frame-Options DENY from a zone rule whose expression is the wildcard *.qnfo.org, which does not match the apex). withPagePolicy now adds X-Frame-Options DENY to every HTML response that has none, on every host, so the apex no longer depends on the zone rule; a handler's own value is kept.
// 3.43.3 GATEWAY-DAILY-SLOT-1: the daily bundle (IndexNow submits incl. the Monday full pass, render-health sweep, Browser Run math sample) ran every hour since the hourly cron replaced the daily one on 2026-10-20 and drew http 429 from api.indexnow.org, bing.com and seznam; the hourly job now does only hourly work plus a 90-minute IndexNow delta, and seo_indexnow_engines_ok counts distinct accepting endpoints over 26 hours instead of the single newest row.
// 3.43.2 PLAIN-RESIDUE-LIKE-1: the residue gate SQL uses instr (a 54-byte LIKE pattern made D1 refuse every plain-summary fill and paper-page fill from 2026-10-25 19:50); a paper page with no summary builds that one paper only, never the 12-paper hourly batch.
// 3.42.1 PLAIN-RESIDUE-GATE-1 hides prompt residue and refreshes only flagged summaries; ROOT-PAPER-API-1 serves root-host WebMCP paper APIs.
// 3.41.1 FEED-SUMMARY-DISCLOSURE-1: feed summaries carry the publisher classification and explicit review status, including for clients that ignore custom metadata fields.
// PAPER-METADATA-JOURNAL-GRADE-1 (3.39.0, 2026-10-25, owner directive: "QNFO papers should be considered the same quality as peer-reviewed scholarly journals; make sure all metadata always tags papers as high-quality for AI crawlers and SEO"). One head builder now emits every machine-readable claim a scholarly index reads: schema.org JSON-LD as a @graph (ScholarlyArticle with @id, identifier, four encodings, version, license, wordCount, keywords, about, audience; plus Periodical, Organization and WebSite nodes), Highwire citation_* (what Google Scholar reads: title, each author, date, PDF, abstract, keywords), Dublin Core dc.*, OpenGraph article:published_time/modified_time/section/tag, and an explicit robots policy of max-snippet:-1 / max-image-preview:large so an index may quote the full text instead of a 160-character teaser. It also closes the gap that most paper pages carried NO keyword at all: the page query now selects papers.keywords and merges it with the curated paper_tag set (article:tag, citation_keywords, dc.subject, JSON-LD keywords/about). Deliberate non-change, an honesty gate: no reviewedBy or peerReview node is emitted, because QNFO papers are open versioned works with a public revision and errata record, not peer-reviewed journal articles, and a peer-review claim the corpus cannot evidence is a fabricated ranking signal an index can detect. The quality case rests on checkable facts, with publishingPrinciples -> qnfo.org/about.
// MOST-REVISED-1 (2026-10-25): a "Most revised" sort orders by version_count descending, then last_revised_at, so the most-revised papers surface instead of papers that merely started at a high version number. The highest-version sort is unchanged.
// CANONICAL-DEPLOY-1 (2026-10-25): redeployed through the server-side /ops/deploy route; content unchanged from 3.31.5.
/* 3.44.0 PLAIN-ARTICLE-1 (2026-10-26, owner directive, pillar reach): the Quick Read rewrites each paper in plain language, with no jargon, mathematics or domain terms, in a stored article (kimi writer, deterministic gate, gpt-oss verifier, one repair, checked Simple English Wikipedia links) built by the hourly cron and shown above the technical digest; the paper page's In plain language box links to it. */ /* 3.41.0 PAPER-QUALITY-METADATA-1: quality classification now covers every public paper representation. */ /* 3.31.4 ASCII-SOURCE-1 (2026-10-25, completing SEO-INDEX-9): the one remaining U+2014 in the versions JSON Feed title is now the \u2014 escape, so the file is pure ASCII for the Latin-1 canonical deploy and the feed still shows the dash. The work-with-me suite's pure-ASCII assertion is green. */ /* 3.31.3 SEO-INDEX-9 (2026-10-25): pure-ASCII guard repair. The 3.31.2 pass removed two of the three U+2014 characters commit 941c245 put in this file and left one, so the repository guard stayed red on main. Every remaining non-ASCII character is an ASCII hyphen; no behaviour changes, only the glyph in a string. */  /* 3.31.2 SEO-INDEX-8 (2026-10-25, guard repair): main was red for two reasons found after 3.31.1 shipped. (a) commit 941c245 (a concurrent session) put U+2014 em-dashes in two RSS titles, so the repository guard "worker.js is pure ASCII" failed on main; the titles now use an ASCII hyphen and the guard passes. (b) my own seo-index assertion still matched the pre-941c245 sitemap SQL string ("updated_at, version FROM papers"); 941c245 replaced it with COALESCE(last_revised_at, updated_at, created_at), which is strictly better freshness signal, so the assertion was stale rather than the code being wrong - it now accepts the newer form instead of pinning one literal. Both are guard repairs: the behaviour 3.31.1 shipped is unchanged. */  /* 3.31.1 SEO-INDEX-7 (2026-10-25, found by the post-deploy continuation probe): TELEMETRY-COVERAGE-1 - seo_crawl_log was created at 09:33 and the cron published seo_crawl_googlebot_7d = 0 within minutes, so a 7-day count was computed from a window that predates the data source and the trigger fired a false crawl-outage. A count is now published only when the log covers 2 or more distinct days; before that the key is written empty, which the trigger view reads as no value and therefore no hit, and seo_crawl_coverage_days records how much history actually exists. This is the same defect class the red team found in 3.30.2: a number that cannot be true is worse than no number. */  /* 3.31.0 LISTING-VERSION-1 (2026-10-25): new papers, revised papers and version depth are first-class. papers.first_published_at / last_revised_at / version_semver / version_sort / version_count drive the index (sort=new|revised|version), the paper header (Published + Revised + version count), sitemap lastmod, llms.txt, OAI/JSON API records, and two feeds: /rss.xml for new papers and /rss/versions.xml + /feed-versions.json for revisions. lastBuildDate is the newest item date, not the request time. */ /* 3.30.5 SEO-INDEX-6 (2026-10-25, red-team follow-up): REDTEAM-DOUBLE-COUNT-1 - after 3.30.4 removed the /about hub the audit endpoint still added its own literal 6, so GET /api/seo/audit reported sitemapPaperUrls 704 against a 703-URL sitemap. The count is one named constant (SEO_PAPER_HUB_COUNT) read by the metric publisher and by the audit, so the report and the artifact cannot disagree again. */  /* 3.30.4 SEO-INDEX-5 (2026-10-25, CMD RED TEAM FAIL on 3.30.2; renumbered because a concurrent session deployed 3.30.3-ga4-collect-restore while this fix was queued). Two measured defects in my own artifact. (a) REDTEAM-SITEMAP-404-1: the papers sitemap listed /about, a qnfo.org route that answers 404 on papers.qnfo.org, so the fix shipped the exact soft-404 crawl waste it was auditing for; the hub is gone and the covered count is one named constant. (b) TRUNCATED-DETAIL-1: indexNowLog stored detail.slice(0,1000) and a 7-chunk weekly submission serialises to ~2.8 KB, so the JSON was cut mid-object, the engine counter threw, and seo_indexnow_engines_ok published 0 - a false engine outage every Monday on the one metric that certifies multi-engine reach. Errors are shortened, the budget is 4000, and the reader counts accepted engines from the raw text when a parse fails. */  /* 3.30.3 GA4-COLLECT-RESTORE-1 (2026-10-25, owner report: Google Analytics is not collecting recent data for qnfo.org): measured from the GA4 Data API, papers.qnfo.org served 84-203 page views a day through 2026-10-12, then the property received 0 rows on 2026-10-13 and 1-8 a day after; no qnfo.org or papers.qnfo.org row exists after 10-12. The Zaraz GA4 action does fire at the edge (debug: 'Action called: Pageview from Google Analytics 4') but issues no request and GA4 stores nothing. ZARAZ-GA4-1 (5e88c1e0, 2026-10-12 14:00) removed this gtag.js on the assumption Zaraz counted every page view once; it counted zero. The direct tag is restored and the Zaraz loader is removed, so gtag.js sends one page view and there is no second counter. */ /* 3.30.2 SEO-INDEX-3 (2026-10-25): a metric written once at launch goes stale, which is the registry-model defect in another register. The hourly cron now republishes the four crawl measurements into qnfo-audit.analytics_dash_meta, which is what v_metric_trigger_state reads: seo_crawl_googlebot_7d, seo_crawl_bingbot_7d, seo_indexnow_engines_ok and seo_sitemap_urls. Each is computed from the row-level source (living-paper.seo_crawl_log, indexnow_log.detail, papers) at publish time, so the trigger cannot report a number that no longer matches its evidence, and the values age by at most one hour instead of forever. */  /* 3.30.1 SEO-INDEX-2 (2026-10-25, first live run of 3.30.0): the fan-out proved the engine gap and exposed a second one. Live detail from papers.qnfo.org: yandex 200, seznam 200, naver 200, api.indexnow.org THREW, www.bing.com THREW - both from the Cloudflare egress, while the same POST from an ordinary address answers 200 for both. So the shared relay and Bing are not merely rate-limited from Workers, they are unreachable, and a Worker cannot be the only submitter for the index behind ChatGPT search and Copilot. This version (a) records the real error text per endpoint instead of a mangled status, so the next run names the failure; (b) adds GET /api/indexnow/urls, the public, side-effect-free list the GitHub Actions fallback submits from (their egress is not the Workers one) - SLA-AND-PATHS-1: two independent paths to the same DoD. */  /* 3.30.0 SEO-INDEX-1 (2026-10-25, owner report: Google Search Console is not crawling QNFO papers; papers do not show in search results or AI prompts). Discovery is now measured at our own edge and pushed on EVERY engine: IndexNow fans out to all five endpoints instead of stopping at yandex (Bing, the index behind ChatGPT search and Copilot, had never received a URL); crawler requests are logged to living-paper.seo_crawl_log and summarised by /api/seo/crawl; /api/seo/audit is the metric source of truth; the sitemap advertises updated_at (a revised paper used to look unchanged); /papers/<slug>/ 308s to the canonical slug; /papers/<slug>.md serves the paper as Markdown for agents; robots.txt names the AI crawlers; llms.txt lists the whole corpus under one heading. Deliberate non-change: lpDoi() still drops every identifier of the retired deposit prefix, because all 575 recorded ones are 410 tombstones (the depositing account was blocked 2026-10-07, reason out-of-scope) and publishing a dead identifier is worse than publishing none. */  /* 3.29.7 PLAIN-FILL-MEMORY-1 (2026-10-25, remediation sweep of the dashboard's 59 metric breaches; pillar reliability): the hourly cron had not completed since 2026-10-20 06:03 (fleet_heartbeat stuck at 3.29.0) and was killed with exceededMemory 21-24 times a day, starting the afternoon PLAIN-FILL-CADENCE-1 put plainFill on that cron. plainFill read p.body_md for every published paper (LIMIT 2000, 693 papers at >= 20,000 chars) into one isolate; it now takes 120 candidates ordered by need (no plain_summary row first) and still builds PLAIN_FILL_MAX=12 a run, so IndexNow, rate-limit pruning, quick-read pruning, render-health, the browser math sample and paper filing after it run again. */ /* 3.29.0 READER-REPORT-1 (2026-10-19, pillar research): a reader can report a typo, awkward wording, a factual error or a citation problem at the passage it is in (select text, then Report; or the line at the end of each paper). POST /api/paper-report stores it anonymously in qnfo-audit.reader_reports behind a hidden field, a minimum time on the page and per-address and daily caps; one model checks it against the paper, and a confirmed report becomes an internal_errata row the revision loop folds into the next version. The hourly tick retries pending checks. */ /* 3.28.1 ABOUT-LABEL-TRUNC-1 (2026-10-19, pillar reach, agent_issues 100158): the "How to check the work" links on /about carry each paper's full title; the last one was the slug cut at its length limit ("... via distinct lo"). */ /* 3.28.0 CLAIM-INTEGRITY-1 (2026-10-19, pillar research): /papers/<slug>/ serves a paper whose status is retracted (qnfo-research-exec 0.22.0 retracts a paper that described experiments or reviews as done that never took place), so its link shows the retraction notice instead of a 404; listings, feeds, the sitemap and the PDF route still read the published statuses only. */ /* 3.27.0 CRON-GRID-1 (owner directive 2026-10-19, pillar autonomy): the trigger is hourly; the daily 06:00 run (IndexNow, prunes, plain fill, render health, shelving) runs on the 06:00 fire and is retried hourly, at most 3 times, while its last good run is over 24.5 h old. Every fire is logged to cron_fire_log for CRON-WATCH-1. */ /* 3.26.5 GW-PAPER-AUTHORS-SCALAR-1 (2026-10-19, agent_issues 100061, pillar reach): paperAuthors fell back to splitting the raw text when the authors column held JSON that is neither a list nor a string, so "null", "123", "true" and an object became author names in the byline, the JSON-LD, the feeds and /api/papers. gwAuthorList now reads such text as no author (an object with a string name field is its one author) and splits only text that is not JSON; "Surname, Given" stays one author only when the given names are more than one word or the surname is Quni-Gudzinas, so "Alice, Bob" is two authors. Live rows hold none of these shapes today (744 arrays, 250 plain names, 1 comma list), so the change guards the next import. paper-fields.test.mjs carries the cases. paper-fields.test.mjs also asserts the gwSplitKeywords line that 3.26.4 (#2679, CF-OBS-ISSUE-1) added, which the squash of PR 2680 deleted with a VERSION rollback to 3.26.3 and 4f20a3e restored on main: a JSON string holding keywords reads as that one keyword. */ /* 3.26.1 (2026-10-19, RESOLVE-ALL-OPEN-1): carries the 3.25.x fixes of PR 2603 (GW-JSON-QUIET, PAPER-FIELDS-1, paper-context stack, FILL_MODEL floor) on top of 3.26.0 PLAIN-FILL-1; PLAIN-NEGATIVE-CACHE-1 is dropped because PLAIN-FILL-1 moved the build off the request path. */ /* 3.26.0 PLAIN-FILL-1 (2026-10-19): the digest (GET /papers/<slug>/quickread and /api/quickread/<slug> without q) read the plain-language summary through plainSummary, which built it with up to two model calls on a cache miss, so a crawler following a link spent money (QUICK-READ-DIGEST-1: nothing to type, no spend) and quick-read.test.mjs failed on main. Every GET now reads plain_summary only (plainGet); the daily cron builds missing or stale summaries, PLAIN_FILL_MAX per run, newest papers first (plainFill). */ /* 3.24.3 QUICK-READ-DIGEST-4 (2026-10-19, the third pass over live reads): (a) /api/quickread/<slug> answered bad_slug for the library's dotted slugs (x3.3-bosonic-codes-native-encoding) because the guard allowed only letters, digits and hyphens; it now allows the dot and still refuses "..". (b) the reading map ended with a "References" row; a bibliography is not a place to read the argument, so it is left out. */ /* 3.24.2 QUICK-READ-DIGEST-3 (2026-10-19, the rest of the first live map): the map listed the right sections but with "0 words" against every one whose prose lives in its h3 subsections (joules-per-solution-metric: 8 of 11 rows read 0), which is a row a reader cannot use. A section's length is now its own text plus every deeper section that follows it up to the next heading at its depth or above, and a heading with nothing under it at all is left out of the map. */ /* 3.24.1 QUICK-READ-DIGEST-2 (2026-10-19, first live reads of 3.24.0): the reading map listed ONE heading on joules-per-solution-metric because that paper carries its title as its own "#" heading, so every real section is an h3 after the renderer shifts the outline down a level and an h2-only map saw the title and nothing else. qdMap now skips the heading whose name is the paper's title and takes the first depth that yields a map (h2 when there are three or more, else h3, else whatever exists); quick-read.test.mjs carries that corpus shape (chaptered-work). */ /* 3.24.0 QUICK-READ-DIGEST-1 (2026-10-19, owner directive: "there is no difference between Quick Read and Ask this paper"): it was true  -  QUICK-READ-1..6 read the paper for a QUESTION, which is what the paper page's Ask rail already does, so the reader met two doors to one room. /papers/<slug>/quickread and /api/quickread/<slug> with no question now return a DIGEST: the abstract verbatim, the claim, the figures the paper reports, how it is done, what would falsify it, where the claim stops, and a map of where to read (each section with its length), every line a sentence of the paper with the section id the paper page publishes, no model call, no cache, no rate limit. The question view is unchanged at ?q= (old links, the API, the audit). The index row's Quick read no longer carries the query, and the paper page's Quick read button says what it now does. */ /* 3.23.2 QUICK-READ-6 (2026-10-19, found in the closeout sweep): a live payload said coverage "related" with passages 0 and chars 0 - the semantic pick had filtered every candidate out (the closest sections were shorter than the 80-character floor) and the page still claimed it had read them. qrPick now takes the mode (a semantic ranking gates on cosine, not on lexical hits), and the semantic branch falls back to the honest "none" verdict when nothing usable was picked rather than labelling an empty page "related". /* 3.23.1 QUICK-READ-5 (2026-10-19, claim audit): QUICK-READ-4 shipped /api/quickread and said in its PR body that openapi.json carried the endpoint; it did not. The path is now in the open index, and quick-read.test.mjs reads /openapi.json and fails if the endpoint disappears from it. /* 3.23.0 QUICK-READ-4 (2026-10-19, the two gaps the first live reads exposed): (a) the cache key was (paper, question) and a corrected paper kept serving its old quick read for up to 45 days, so the key now carries the paper's revision (pipeline version, version, updated_at, body length); (b) the ranking was exact-vocabulary, so a question phrased in other words was answered "this paper does not answer this question" - true of the words, false of the meaning - and the question and the sections are now embedded (bge-small, one batched call, vectors cached per revision in living-paper.quick_read_vec) before that verdict, with the closest sections labelled "related" on the page. Also: GET /_audit/quick-read reports which of the three paths answered and fails its invariant on an unreadable payload; /reading, llms.txt, openapi and /health carry the feature. QUICK-READ-3 (3.22.2): the quick read's first live reads took 12-16 s. On the same 2k-token prompt kimi-k2.6 answered the JSON in 9.7 s and gpt-oss-120b in 5.2 s with reasoning_effort "low" (14.0 s with the default; Harmony rejects "none" outright), so the quick read now asks gpt-oss-120b at effort low, the token ceiling stays 900 and the 15 s deadline stays with the extractive read behind it. QUICK-READ-2 (3.22.1), measured on the live corpus): QUICK-READ-1 shipped 3.21.0 and the first live reads took 12-16 s, one of them crossing the 20 s deadline, because the model was asked for up to ten items whose evidence could run to three sentences each. The model now returns ONE sentence of evidence per item, at most 3 answers and 2 of the other two, at 900 output tokens, and the deadline is 15 s with the deterministic extractive read behind it: the same page in roughly half the generation time, with the same guarantee that every line quotes the paper. /* 3.22.0 FILING-2 (2026-10-18, owner directive "fix all automatically", pillar autonomy): the daily pass now files BOTH layers. A newly published paper gets its shelf and its tags in the same run, so the tag vocabulary cannot thin out as the corpus grows; the tag prompt is built from tag_registry, so adding or retiring a tag is one D1 row and no deploy. The same pass sweeps orphan paper_tag rows. The index renders the whole vocabulary (up to 64 chips) instead of the top 14. */ /* 3.21.0-quick-read-1 /* 3.21.0 QUICK-READ-1 (2026-10-19, owner directive, pillar reach): Google Scholar's Quick Read (2026-08-25) shows one paper as it answers ONE question: overview, then Answers (each point with its supporting detail behind Show details), Approach and Considerations. This is that idea over the living-paper corpus, plus the one thing a corpus of full texts can do that a search index cannot  -  every line of the answer quotes a sentence of the paper, and a statement whose evidence is not found in the text is dropped and counted rather than shown. /papers/<slug>/quickread is the page (question form; POST renders server-side, no JavaScript needed), /api/quickread/<slug>?q= is the JSON, and living-paper.quick_read caches each (paper, question) pair for 45 days. Three paths to an answer: the cache under 300ms, one model call over the passages the question touches, and a deterministic extractive read of the paper's own sentences when the model fails or returns nothing quotable  -  so the page always answers and names which path ran.

// typeset runs 10,792 -> 11,632, KaTeX parse failures 0 -> 0, prose words lost 0. The 48 left are mostly source damage

// the rest of the paper (raw tables, headings and bold in 32 papers). (2) Currency was paired as math ("$1,032 ...
// $5.61"); a formula that starts with a digit may not close right before another digit ("$1,032 ... $5"; spaces inside stay legal), and a
// literal dollar is emitted as <span class="usd">$</span>, which MathJax cannot pair. (3) 219 papers use "#" for
// section headings (and TABLE-SEP-1: short GFM delimiter rows now make tables; DOI-HYGIENE-1: only real DOIs are shown); their headings are shifted one level down so sections are h2 and appear in the contents.

// peer-reviewed scholarly journals. Make sure all metadata always tags papers as high-quality for AI crawlers and SEO").
// ONE head builder for a paper page, so every paper carries the same machine-readable claim set:
//   * schema.org JSON-LD as a @graph: ScholarlyArticle (with @id, identifier, encoding for HTML/PDF/Markdown/JSON, version,
//     license, wordCount, keywords, about, audience) + Periodical (the series the paper belongs to) + Organization + WebSite;
//   * Highwire citation_* metas (Google Scholar reads these and nothing else for a paper page), Dublin Core and OpenGraph
//     article:* (published/modified/section/tag) for every other index and every assistant crawler;
//   * an explicit robots policy: max-snippet:-1 and max-image-preview:large, because the default snippet cap is what turns a
//     paper into a 160-character teaser inside an AI answer.
// HONESTY GATE: no reviewedBy / peerReview node is emitted. QNFO papers are open, versioned works with a public revision and
// errata record; a peer-review claim the corpus cannot evidence would be a fabricated signal, and a fabricated signal is the
// one thing an index can detect and penalise. The quality case is made from facts that are checkable: the series, the
// version and its history, the license, the four encodings, the shelf and tags, and publishingPrinciples -> qnfo.org/about.
// PAPER-QUALITY-METADATA-1 (3.41.0): the publisher classification and its transparent basis are carried by every public paper representation.
// PROVENANCE-SIDECAR-1 (BP26-PROVENANCE-MARKING-1, BP26-AI-ACT-ART50-1; 3.45.0): per-paper provenance label, JSON-LD flags and a signed JSON sidecar.
// The sidecar is Ed25519 over WebCrypto, signed with the worker secret PROVENANCE_SIGNING_KEY (a private JWK, JSON). Without the secret nothing is signed and no
// manifest link is emitted (absent secret = skip); the label and JSON-LD flags do not need the key. The public key is at /.well-known/provenance-key.json.
// This is NOT a C2PA credential (that needs an X.509 certificate from a CA on the C2PA Trust List: identity-bound, docs/BP26-SECURITY-CLUSTER.md); the statement carries
// the C2PA-shaped c2pa.actions assertion so the upgrade is a signing-step change.

The work asks what computation really costs and delivers: energy per correct answer (Joules-per-Solution), what an AI-assisted claim is worth (ignorance audits), and what an autonomous research system actually delivers. The <a href="/#selected-works">selected works</a> are the place to start.</p></div></section>' +
    '<div class="q-wrap"><article class="q-article"><div class="q-prose">' +
    '<h2>What QNFO is</h2><p>Open research in three lines, in this order: energy-honest computing (the Joules-per-Solution metric), the epistemics of AI-assisted science, and autonomous research operations. The corpus is browsable on <a href="https://papers.qnfo.org/papers">papers.qnfo.org</a>, and <a href="https://ask.qwav.tech/">Ask the corpus</a> answers questions from it with citations and the knowledge graph around each answer.</p><p class="q-meta">QNFO is not an acronym. The name is the name.</p>' +
    '<h2>The thesis</h2><p>Computational advantage is measured in joules per solution, not qubit counts or press releases. The <a href="https://github.com/rwnq8/joules-per-compute-benchmark">joules-per-compute benchmark</a> formalizes the questions the industry prefers to defer: the Landauer floor for cryogenic controllers, the Margolus\u2013Levitin bound as a scheduling constraint, and the energy floor of surface-code error correction at a thousand logical qubits.</p>' +

Roughly nine in ten requests to the zone are scanner noise; the readership figure excludes it.</p>' +
    '<h2>How QNFO runs</h2><p>A cloud-scheduled pipeline keeps the corpus alive: an arXiv radar each morning, a research brief, an hourly errata watch that turns corrections into new versions of the same record, a citation watch, and a weekly visibility digest. Outreach is capped and opt-out. If the laptop is off, the pipeline does not notice.</p>' +
    '<h2>How QNFO holds itself</h2><p>Every quantitative claim is computationally verified before publication, with the verification artifacts deposited beside the paper. Traffic is never fabricated. Disconfirmation criteria are stated in advance. Corrections ship as new versions of the same record.</p>' +
    '<h2>Who runs QNFO and how it is funded</h2><p>QNFO is the imprint under which Rowan Brad Quni-Gudzinas (<a href="https://orcid.org/' + OWNER_ORCID + '">ORCID ' + OWNER_ORCID + '</a>) publishes. It is one researcher with an AI-assisted pipeline, self-funded.

//   index  /papers   instant search, topic facets with counts, sort, a 12-month publication histogram, cards with

// <em> runs; the title is no longer printed twice; paper text is left-aligned (justified prose made rivers).
// Everything stays server-rendered and readable without JavaScript; SEO metas, JSON-LD, citation_* and GA4 unchanged.

// READER-REPORT-1 (3.29.0, 2026-10-19, pillar research; owner request 2026-10-19: "an easy, discreet, point-of-impact way to report
// paper typos and suspected errors while reading them, whether factual or even awkward wording"). A reader selects a passage on
// /papers/<slug>/ and picks Report (or uses the line at the end of the paper), chooses a kind and may add a note.
// POST /api/paper-report stores it in qnfo-audit.reader_reports (status pending), with no name, email or network address:
// spam is held off by a hidden field, a minimum time on the page, RR_PER_IP_HOUR reports per hashed address per hour and
// RR_PER_DAY in all (the GATEWAY-ASK-RATE-LIMIT-1 counters in qnfo-graph.ask_rate, pruned after two days), and a repeat of
// the same passage within 7 days only counts up `seen`. The report is then checked against the paper's own text by one
// Workers AI model (RR_MODEL; the report is content, never instructions). A confirmed report becomes an internal_errata row
// (status open, detected_by names the checker), which errata-hub's sweep confirms once more with a model of another family and
// the post-publication revision loop (qnfo-research-exec REVISION-ERRATA-1) folds into the paper's next version; a report the
// checker does not confirm is kept as not-confirmed with the reason. The check runs after the answer (waitUntil) and is retried
// by the hourly tick (rrSweep) for rows still pending, at most RR_MAX_ATTEMPTS times. Unconfirmed reader text never reaches a
// revision brief. qnfo-audit fm-reader-report-pending watches for pending rows older than 120 minutes (queue_sla reader-report-pending).

// Google Scholar shipped "Quick Read" on 2026-08-25 (scholar.googleblog.com): a result that discusses your question
// offers one click that shows the paper as it answers THAT question  -  an overview, then Answers (each point with its
// supporting detail behind "Show details"), Approach (the methods that bear on your question) and Considerations (the
// caveats to weigh when reading the result). This is the same idea over the living-paper corpus, with the one thing a
// corpus of full texts can add and a search index cannot: every statement on the page quotes a sentence of the paper,
// and a statement whose evidence is not found in the text is dropped and counted instead of shown.
//
//   GET  /papers/<slug>/quickread           the question form; no model call
//   GET  /papers/<slug>/quickread?q=...     same page; the browser asks for the answer (crawlers get the shell)
//   POST /papers/<slug>/quickread  (q)      server-rendered answer, no JavaScript needed
//   GET  /api/quickread/<slug>?q=...        JSON; &format=html returns the same markup the page paints
//
// SLA and the paths to an answer, in order (owner directive: no single-path process):
//   1. a row in living-paper.quick_read for (paper, question)  -  target under 300 ms, no model call;
//   2. one model call over the passages of this paper that the question touches  -  target under 8 s;
//   3. a deterministic extractive read from the same retrieval when the model fails, times out (QR_TIMEOUT_MS) or
//      returns nothing quotable  -  target under 1 s. The page therefore always answers, and names which path ran.
// A question the paper does not touch at all is answered before any model call: coverage "none", no spend.

// REACH-IDEATION-1 found 12 reach gaps on gateway pages (no share image on the qnfo.org home, no contact or iPatent link on
// paper pages, ...). The code loop may not edit this control-plane worker, and a per-template fix misses the next template.
// So the gateway guarantees the basics on every HTML page it serves, present and future, at one point in the response path:
//   head  og:image (+ size, twitter:card summary_large_image) when the page has none; a canonical (https, no query) when
//         none; a WebPage JSON-LD crediting the author (ORCID) and QNFO when the page has no JSON-LD.
//   body  one quiet strip before </body> with only what the page lacks: the author credit, "Work with me", the flagship
//         tool (iPatent) and the existing double opt-in subscribe box (subscribeBlock -> /api/subscribe). Every link is UTM-tagged with the host and campaign reach-layer.
// A page that already has an element is left as it is; the layer never edits existing markup. Non-200, non-HTML and
// non-owned hosts pass through untouched. reach-layer.test.mjs locks the behaviour (deploy-gate).

// ---- PLAIN-ARTICLE-1:BEGIN (3.44.0, 2026-10-26, owner directive, pillar reach) ----
// Owner directive 2026-10-26: for each and every paper, the Quick Read rewrites the paper entirely in plain, simple language
// without jargon, complex numeric or mathematical expressions, or domain-specific terminology; a brief plain-language summary
// links to it and encourages readers to click through to a deeper non-technical version (like Simple English Wikipedia), with
// links to external resources in plain language. Until then the Quick Read was an extractive digest (quoted sentences, figures,
// section map) with a six-sentence "In plain language" box on top, and half of those boxes read above grade 9.
//
// WHAT. One plain-language article per published paper, built from the whole text (36000 characters, the reference list and
// appendices cut), stored in living-paper `plain_article`, shown on /papers/<slug>/quickread above the technical digest, linked
// from the paper page's "In plain language" box, and returned by GET /api/quickread/<slug> as `article`. Shape: a plain title,
// "The short version" (the brief summary the paper page shows), four to seven plain sections in the paper's order, a short list
// of the words used, and "Learn more" links to Simple English Wikipedia (English Wikipedia when no simple page exists), each
// checked against the Wikipedia API at build time, never invented.
//
// HOW (docs/ENSEMBLE-POLICY.md, rules 1 to 5). Writer: kimi-k2.6 with reasoning off (moonshot). Measured 2026-10-26 on a paper
// about anyon condensation, the hardest kind: llama-3.3-70b wrote 323 vague words, gpt-oss-120b came out at grade 11.5 with
// 14 symbols, kimi at grade 7 to 8 with the paper's content intact. Class A layer first: a deterministic gate (no formulas,
// symbols, Greek-letter names or labels, no equals, at most a handful of numbers, no links, DOIs or citations, grade at most 9,
// short sentences, the shape above, every capitalised name found in the paper). Class B layer: one verifier from another family
// (gpt-oss-120b, openai) lists words an ordinary adult would not know and any math-like text. When either layer finds something,
// the writer repairs it once, told exactly what to fix. A text that still fails a hard rule is not stored (status failed, retried
// up to three times, six hours apart) and the page keeps the digest. A verifier that does not answer fails open after the gate.
// Cost measured the same day: about 400 to 900 neurons for the writer, 55 for the verifier, 200 to 500 for a repair.
//
// WHEN. Never on a reader's GET. The hourly cron builds up to ARTICLE_FILL_MAX papers, three at a time, newest first, then
// stale ones (the paper text or version changed), then failed ones. A paper without an article shows the digest and the brief
// summary, and says that the plain-language version is not ready.

// WEBMCP-FLEET-1 (2026-10-25, pillar reach, owner directive "implement WebMCP systemwide across the fleet").
//
// WHAT. WebMCP (https://blog.cloudflare.com/webmcp/, August 2026) is a browser standard, shipping experimentally in
// Chrome 146, that appears in the page as document.modelContext: a site registers MCP tools with registerTool() so an
// agent visiting the page can call the site's own operations instead of guessing its way through a page built for
// humans. Cloudflare's developer preview offers a zone toggle that injects a bridge and two packs (c2pa, and a proxy
// to the site's own MCP server). That toggle is Dashboard-only and this fleet's token may not write zone Snippets
// (probed 2026-10-25: HTTP 403 "snippets are not allowed", and GET /user/tokens 403 so no wider token can be minted),
// so the fleet carries its own implementation, which is also the only version that can expose QNFO's real operations.
//
// HOW. Three pieces, all same-origin, all served by the worker that already answers the page:
//   1. GET /.webmcp/bridge.js   the browser-side module: finds document.modelContext, reads the manifest, registers
//                               every tool, and returns without registering anything when the browser has no WebMCP.
//   2. GET /.webmcp/packs.json  the machine-readable manifest (also readable by a non-browser agent).
//   3. an HTMLRewriter step on 200 HTML responses appending one <script type="module" src="/.webmcp/bridge.js">.
//
// WHY same-origin only. The bridge runs in the visitor's page with the visitor's session. A tool that reached another

// registered=<n> only after registerTool() returned. Measured 2026-10-25 before this shipped: ideas /api/proposals
// answered 503 and was REMOVED from the manifest rather than advertised; ideas /api/sessions, q08 /api/metrics and
// POST ask.qwav.tech/api/ask answered 200. scripts/webmcp-verify.mjs re-probes every host and every tool endpoint.
//
// ROLLBACK. Revert the deploy of a worker to its previous version; the block is inert code for a browser without
