# The QNFO portfolio (QNFO-PORTFOLIO-1)

Portfolio policy 1.0.1, 2026-10-01 (1.0.1: the loop repairs hygiene itself, PORTFOLIO-HYGIENE-1). The QNFO GitHub organisation is the public face of everything the Quniverse
produces: the fleet, the research programs, the papers' source, the demos, the licence and the organisation profile.
This document is the policy half of the portfolio; the live half (section 5, between the `PORTFOLIO-LIVE` markers) is
regenerated daily by `qnfo-fleet-control` (PORTFOLIO-LOOP-1) from the live organisation and the program registry.
The same evaluation also rewrites the public mirror `QNFO/.github/PORTFOLIO.md` and the portfolio index in the
organisation profile README, so every surface says the same thing on the same day.

Owner directive (2026-10-01): check every QNFO repository and unify, consolidate and link all resources as one
portfolio, automatically and without further involvement.

## 1. What was found (2026-10-01)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Repositories in the organisation | 122 (116 public and private non-forks, plus 11 forks) |
| Archived | 74 |
| Active, non-fork | 42, of which 10 private |
| Active public repositories without a licence file | 36 of 42 (the organisation's licence lives in `QNFO/license` and is not propagated) |
| Active public repositories without a description or topics | 8 each |
| Existing inventories | three, all stale and disagreeing: `QNFO/.github/PORTFOLIO.md` (knowledge-graph snapshot of 2026-08-13), `qnfo-audit.repo_inventory` (49 rows from July under the owner's personal account), the WBS table in the organisation profile README |
| Weekly status writer | `qnfo-cloud-ops` already rewrites `QNFO/.github/PORTFOLIO-STATUS.md` (counts only) |
| Program registry | `portfolio-state.program_registry`: 79 WBS rows, 17 programs, of which 15 name a GitHub repository |

The repositories are real and mostly fine; the portfolio layer around them was hand-made and had stopped being
maintained. The fix is the same as for the charter: one measured register, three generated surfaces, no hand editing.

## 2. One portfolio, four surfaces

| Surface | Where | What it holds | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Register | D1 `qnfo-audit.portfolio_repos` (+ `portfolio_sync_runs`) | one row per repository: tier, charter pillar, visibility, WBS codes, hygiene flags, last push | PORTFOLIO-LOOP-1, daily |
| Live JSON | `GET https://qnfo-fleet-control.q08.workers.dev/portfolio` | the register and the last sync run | served from D1 |
| This document | `QNFO/qnfo-workers/docs/PORTFOLIO.md` | policy (sections 1 to 4) and the live block (section 5) | hand (policy) + loop (live block) |
| Public mirror | `QNFO/.github/PORTFOLIO.md` and the `PORTFOLIO-LIVE` block in `QNFO/.github/profile/README.md` | the public inventory and the index on the organisation landing page | loop, fully generated |

Superseded, kept for history, no longer written: `qnfo-audit.repo_inventory`, the hand-written WBS table in the
profile README (the generated index sits above it), the 2026-08-13 snapshot text of `QNFO/.github/PORTFOLIO.md`.
The WBS codes themselves stay canonical in `portfolio-state.program_registry`; the loop reads them, never writes them.

## 3. Tiers and the rules that assign them

Every repository gets exactly one tier, in this order of precedence, and every tier maps to one charter pillar
(`docs/QUNIVERSE-CHARTER.md` section 3.2). The rules are `pfTier` in `qnfo-fleet-control/worker.js`; the lists are
short on purpose, so a new platform or governance repository is a one-line change there.

| Tier | Rule | Pillar | Graded for hygiene |
|---|---|---|---|
| archived | GitHub `archived` flag | research (legacy) | no |
| fork | GitHub `fork` flag | core | no |
| platform | named in `PF_PLATFORM`: qnfo-workers, qnfo-ops, qnfo-skills, qnfo-schemas, infrastructure, qnfo-infra, qnfo-releases, qnfo-model-router, qnfo-errata-pipeline, qnfo-setup-bootstrap, qnfo-fleet-issues, qwav-platform, personal-life-workers, qnfo-ensemble-research | core | yes |
| governance | `.github`, `license`, `gitbook` | autonomy | yes |
| client-config | `deepchat`, `.deepchat`, `qnfo-config-backup` (private) | personal | no, and never named publicly |
| demo | `qwav-demo-*`, `qwav-demos` | reach | yes |
| research | everything else | research | yes |

Hygiene flags on graded repositories: `no-description`, `no-license`, `no-topics`, `dormant-<n>d` (no push for more
than 120 days). The hygiene score is the share of graded public repositories with none of the first three flags;
private repositories are counted, never named and never repaired, so they do not enter the score (HYGIENE-SCOPE-1).

## 4. Portfolio rules (binding on every session and worker)

1. **A repository is a portfolio item or it does not exist.** A new QNFO repository names its tier (by the rules above)
   and, if it is research, a WBS code in `program_registry` within one sync. The loop fills an empty `github_repo`
   itself when the registry row's slug equals the repository name or the repository's description names the code
   (PORTFOLIO-HYGIENE-1); it lists the rest every day until a session registers them.
2. **Fewer, linked, described.** Every active public repository carries a description, topics and a licence. The
   licence is the QNFO Unified License Agreement v2.0 (`QNFO/license`, SPDX `LicenseRef-QNFO-ULA-2.0`), which applies
   by its own scope to every repository of the organisation, code included; GitHub reports it as `NOASSERTION`, which
   counts as licensed. The loop repairs the gaps itself, at most 12 actions per sync: a missing LICENSE file is created
   from `QNFO/license` (never replaced), an empty description is taken from the README's first real paragraph (a
   line of labelled fields such as "Status: ... | Phase: ..." is never used), missing topics are the tier baseline plus
   the slugs of the programs served. A description the loop wrote is re-derived every sync and corrected or cleared
   when the README changes; a description a person wrote is never touched. Every action is a `portfolio_actions` row
   (`GET /portfolio` lists the last forty) and the next sync measures it; `portfolio_hygiene` is graded in the charter
   under the autonomy pillar (target >= 0.9).
3. **Archive, do not delete.** A research repository that is dormant for 120+ days and has no WBS code is an archive
   candidate. The loop proposes; a session archives (reversible), or the loop does when an explicit `portfolio_actions`
   row asks for it (`action = archive-request`, `status = requested`, written by an issue or a session: REPO-ARCHIVE-1,
   2026-10-06, because the session GitHub proxy refuses repository settings writes). Nothing is ever deleted.
4. **Private stays private.** Private repositories are counted in every surface and named in none.
5. **One identity.** Public text says `QNFO` (the imprint) and names Rowan Brad Quni-Gudzinas as author of record;
   never "Research Foundation", "Collective" or "Program" as an organisation name (STRATEGY-1 section 2.1).
6. **The fleet is the writer.** Portfolio surfaces are regenerated by the loop; a hand edit to a generated surface is
   overwritten on the next sync. Policy changes go through a pull request to this document and `pfTier`.
7. **Public pages are part of the portfolio.** Repositories with GitHub Pages (`has_pages`) and a homepage are linked
   from the inventory; the fleet's own sites (qnfo.org, papers.qnfo.org, fleet.qnfo.org) are linked from the mirror.

How it runs: `portfolioSyncIfStale` on the kernel's hourly cron (syncs when the last successful run is older than
20 hours, within 50 minutes after a partial run or after a run that took hygiene actions, and on the first tick after
every kernel deploy, so a change to the loop verifies itself within the hour and a backlog of flagged repositories
clears at twelve an hour; DEPLOY-SYNC-1), `POST /portfolio/sync` with the admin token on demand. A failed
organisation fetch writes nothing. Every run is a `portfolio_sync_runs` row with the per-surface commit status.
`charter-guard` fails CI if this document loses its markers; `portfolio.test.mjs` replays the organisation fixture
through the classifier and the three renderers on every pull request that touches the kernel.

- Research repositories to register in portfolio-state.program_registry: ultrametric-lean, ignorance-audit, agentic-collapse
- Hygiene (description, licence, topics) to fix: qwav-demo-monna-map-perspective (no-description)
