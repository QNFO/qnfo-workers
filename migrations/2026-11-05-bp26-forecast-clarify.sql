-- BP26-FORECAST-CLARIFY-1 (2026-11-05, charter pillar research; breach forecast_resolution_criteria_complete, trigger 14490, agent_issues 1000671; practice BP26-FORECAST-HYGIENE-1, 1000337).
-- WHAT WAS MEASURED (q08-signal D1, read-only, 2026-11-04 23:00Z): three open forecasts (ids 2, 3, 4, published 2026-10-26, before the 0.38.0 gate), 0 of 3 complete. Forecast 3 (Broadcom) and 4 (TrendForce)
--   name a source and a date but state no edge-case rule; forecast 2 (PJM) names its source only in watch_urls and states no edge-case rule either. New forecasts are gated (validateForecast), but none has been
--   published since 2026-10-26 (q08_forecasts holds 4 rows), and the share is taken over OPEN forecasts, so it could not move.
-- WHY THE EARLIER FIX NEVER FIRED: FORECAST-CRITERIA-REPUBLISH-1 (issue 1000740, closed) added a sweep that voids and republishes. It read q08_forecasts.resolution_text, which is the settling verdict and NULL on every
--   open row, so it skipped every row; it tested the literal words "source" and "edge case" instead of the three patterns the metric and the gate use; and it called generateForecast(env, { replaceId }) although
--   that function takes a start time and runs the whole compose pipeline. Made to work it would have voided three live public forecasts and spent three compose runs on an unbounded retry.
-- FIX (q08-signal-engine, offline suite q08-signal-engine/forecast-clarify.test.mjs, 17 checks): the published text stays immutable. A legacy forecast gains one dated, append-only clarification beside it
--   (table q08_forecast_clarifications, one row per forecast and kind, update and delete refused by trigger), written from facts the row already holds: watch_urls as the source, the horizon as the date, and the
--   settling rule resolveForecasts already applies (evidence dated on or before the horizon; undecidable after four weekly checks is void and unscored). It documents how the resolver behaves; it changes no outcome
--   and no score. A forecast whose source cannot be named from its own record is left alone, so that gap stays visible. The page shows the clarification under the original text, /api/forecasts carries it,
--   and scripts/bp26_forecast.py reads resolution plus clarification (it falls back to the bare text while the table does not exist).
-- PREDICTION: forecast_resolution_criteria_complete 0 -> 1.0 (3 of 3) at the first producer run after the worker deploys and its next cron tick; stays 1.0 while every new forecast passes the gate. Guard: no forecast
--   is voided, regenerated or rescored (the suite asserts it).
-- ALSO CORRECTS my note of the same day on agent_issues 1000670 (migrations/2026-11-05-bp26-ib-cards-and-latency-notes.sql): lever (1), one remediation row per paper, is already in routeHighRiskErrata (groups by slug,
--   merges into an unstarted row; 4 residual duplicates predate it); the throttle on remediation is RESEARCH-BACKPRESSURE-1 with RB-ERRATA-SHARE-1 (488 remediation rows deferred at "ready queue at capacity (192)") and
--   revision_loop_mode off, which is the cost lane.
