"""CI-ACTION-IDENTITY-1 offline suite for scripts/ci_watchdog.py and scripts/ci_watchdog_resolve.py (no network).

Proves, for the workflows that run a different action per manual dispatch (cf-ops-actions, owner-client-keys,
fleet-autodeploy; ci-watchdog #1033):
  * a dispatched run whose run-name names the action is keyed per action; push and plain runs keep the workflow name
  * only a later green run of the SAME action supersedes or closes a failed one
  * the action's own RESULT_JSON line becomes the finding's fix line, not "inspect the job log"
  * the three workflows declare a run-name that names the action
Run: python3 scripts/ci_watchdog_action_test.py   -> "N passed, 0 failed"
